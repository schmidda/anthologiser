<head type="title">The True Finality.</head>

<p>Note. We can scarcely insist too sweepingly upon the infinite<lb/> necessity there exists of a people's keeping morally up with, if<lb/> not a head of its physical progress. Such a marriage in<lb/> human advancement, in so far at least as our purposes can<lb/> effect it, is the only proper Finality. There is little fear of<pb n="6" facs="C376/00000006.jpg"/> any nation (the French perhaps excepted) going ahead <emph rend="ul">too</emph><lb/> <emph rend="ul">fast</emph> in this respect. Of the Anglo Saxon races doing so,<lb/> there is none. But there is constant and deadly peril of<lb/> their lagging morally and intellectually too far behind their<lb/> physical improvement&#x2014;in which event, their material wealth<lb/> is but their accumulated bane; and for which cause, I repeat<lb/> it, we can scarcely keep dinning them too sweepingly with<lb/> the necessity of an equal spiritual enrichment.</p>

<p rend="indent">As for John Bull himself, as a moralist and<lb/> political philosopher,&#x2014;he is proverbially "slow-bellied". The<lb/> bare idea of "moving on" institutionally, has to be driven into<lb/> his hard head as with a sledge-hammer; and the operator<lb/> must still hammer away at it, to keep it there, or he will<lb/> inevitably scratch it out again, in the digital dubiety of his<lb/> <del>extreme</del> disinclination to budge. Then another notion,&#x2014;quite<lb/> an ultra radical one, must be pounded into it in the same<lb/> way, not to move him of itself, but simply to cause the<lb/> first to fructify and grow out into act. That is, he is<lb/> urged by the first, we will suppose, to go forward to meet<lb/> the necessity of the times <emph rend="ul">just a rod</emph> and no further. He<lb/> doubts&#x2014;argues&#x2014;thinks he will&#x2014;thinks he won't&#x2014;resolves<lb/>&#x2014;procrastinates. By the second he is twitted with being<lb/> a beef-witted laggard, and <subst><del>adjured</del> <add>conjured</add></subst> to expunge the<lb/> reproach forever, by dashing / that is waddling) onward<lb/> a <emph rend="ul">whole mile</emph> at a heat, like a true British lion in chase<lb/> of a French donkey. This, however, "he'll be damned if<lb/> he'll do", notwithstanding the flattering unction administered<lb/> through the flourish about the lion (it being a thoroughly<lb/> English one): but he will then comply, perhaps, with the<pb n="7" facs="C376/00000006.jpg"/> requirement of the first&#x2014;and advance grumblingly, <emph rend="ul">just<lb/> a rod</emph>. But not directly&#x2014;<del>oh, no!</del> not until the <add>exact</add> distance <lb/>has been measured and remeasured, with mathematical<lb/> accuracy, by two paid surveyors, the one to act as a check<lb/> upon the other.</p>

<p rend="indent">When Rosseau desiderated the savage state as the<lb/> noblest for man, he was wrong. But he was led into the<lb/> error by the partial perception of a great truth: namely,<lb/> that the best condition for the developement of the full<lb/> majesty of man, were one in which the personal<lb/> freedom and <del>s[unclear]</del> sovereignty of savage life should<lb/> co-exist with all the artistic beneficences and moral<lb/> security <add>of</add> civilized society. And such a condition is <add>indeed</add> the<lb/> great end of all human community&#x2014;is <del>indeed</del>,<lb/>Social Individualization, the Finality of the future.</p>

<p rend="indent">And educative and social Individualization<lb/> should also be infinitely more than it is, the Finality<lb/> of the present<subst><del>. In</del><add>: in</add></subst> other words, a teaching and employing<lb/> process by which every individual might be improved to the<lb/> full extent, <del>[?]after</del> and according to the specific character of<lb/> his capacity. This is demanded by a new and singular<lb/> (self-sustained and sustaining) order of consciousness,<lb/> which is fast developing itself in the whole human race.<lb/> All the great political, social, and religious interests that<lb/> were <del>only</del> originally only operant as motive powers upon<lb/> men in <del>[unclear]</del> bodies or nationally, are beginning more<lb/> and more to centre and manifest themselves in Man<lb/> the Individual. Centuries of thought and self-investigation<lb/>&#x2014;the experience for good and evil of entire races;&#x2014;these,<pb n="8" facs="C376/00000007.jpg"/> in effect, are becoming const<subst><del>e</del><add>i</add></subst>tutionally accumulated,<lb/> and additionally transmissive, in single individuals.</p>

<p rend="indent">Hence "the greatest good to the greatest number" <emph rend="ul">is<lb/> not</emph> a final principle of human community, and is<lb/> fast giving place to another <del>which</del> that <emph rend="ul">is</emph>: namely,<lb/> <emph rend="ul">the greatest good to each and all</emph>. Hence too, men<lb/> can be no longer the creatures of Governments: these<lb/> can no longer mould them characteristically into masses;<lb/> because the associative tendencies of all are beginning<lb/> to cognise and perfect their end in each. Even the<lb/> Austrian,&#x2014;<del>V</del> even the thinking Russian, can now<lb/> grow up under the thrundrous shadow of his paternal<lb/> despotism, with a distinct personal consciousness<lb/> of inherent independence&#x2014;of <add>the self-possession</add> spiritual
prerogatives<lb/> which reduce it, even in its apparent almightiness,<lb/> to a mere temporal accident; and he can dare to<lb/> look it in the face therefore, as being a Thing only,&#x2014;<lb/>an awful one indeed, but which, as a Person,&#x2014;as<lb/> a Man, he has a right to question. <ref>&#x203B;</ref></p>

<p rend="indent">And as this Individualizing process grows<lb/> natively <add hand="pencil">[?]and [?]inevitably</add> out of the Past, it cannot be arrested. It<lb/> <subst><del>must</del> <add>should</add></subst> be carried forward then; and for this to be<lb/> done harmoniously, individual education upon the<lb/>most liberal and adaptative scale must be speedily<lb/> resorted to; so that all men, having progressed beyond<lb/> the state legislation contemporaneously obtaining, may<lb/> become more and more, to the destined extent,&#x2014;each<lb/> and all of them, Governments in themselves. This<pb n="9" facs="C376/00000007.jpg"/> great Fact, I repeat it (to begin with the beginning<lb/> of the better time coming) is the great Finality of the<lb/> Future&#x2014;and should be infinitely more than it is, that<lb/> of the Present as well.</p>

<p rend="indent">But alas! it would seem that in Australia,<lb/> we are still to be prevented of all efficient means for<lb/> ac<add>c</add>elerating the march of knowledge, by the <del>jealousies</del><lb/> irrational bigotries of Sectarian Cliques. A system<lb/> of general
education is offered to the country, and forthwith<lb/> upstarts the parson, to denounce it as improper for <emph rend="ul">his</emph><lb/> people. The priest also, for once partially in tune with<lb/> him, joins the clerical crusade, and stigmatises it as<lb/> unsuitable for <emph rend="ul">his</emph> people. For <emph rend="ul">their</emph> people forsooth?<lb/> Who made them <emph rend="ul">theirs</emph>? Did God, think you? He did<lb/> nothing of the kind. He made each and all of us<lb/> for ourselves as well as for others&#x2014;to choose our way,<lb/> and walk singly, as individually accountable men, and<lb/> not to be herded, like cattle, into <add>[?]blanket</add> sects: and until we<lb/> manfully feel this <add>to be the truth</add>, we shall continue the unthinking<lb/> tools of designing badge-wearers and
prejudice-mongers,<lb/> who have vowed themselves, body and soul, to the separative<lb/> formularies of an ignorant and illiberal Past.</p>

<p rend="indent">And all this hub-bub amongst them&#x2014;this goose-<lb/>cackling tempest, was occasioned by each Sect stickling<lb/> for its catechism! Now an educational System<lb/> that cat[e]chetically forbids doubt upon any subject, thereby<lb/> precluding, or endeavouring to preclude, its future<lb/> investigation on the part of the pupil, must be pernicious;<lb/> because, in the first place, he should be bound in nowise<lb/> to remain the child of any system, but left perfectly<pb n="10" facs="C376/00000008.jpg"/> free to become the thinking child
of man; and because,<lb/> in the next place, the more all things <emph rend="ul">are investigated</emph><lb/> the more Truth will be expressed,&#x2014;it being indeed the<lb/> very essence and virtue of every thing real, of every<lb/> thing having a primordial vitality. Error only<lb/> would impose shackles upon mind. Truth is<lb/> Liberty.</p>

<p rend="indent">"But Religion&#x2014;Religion!" Well: what can<lb/> true Religion have to fear from <subst><del>Truth</del> <add>Knowledge</add></subst> the <subst><del>offspring</del> <add>correlative</add></subst><lb/> of <subst><del>Knowledge</del> <add>Truth</add></subst>? Or if Superstition be necessary to<lb/> hold Ignorance in order, should the people be kept<lb/> illiterate for the sake of <subst><del>such a consequence</del> <add>a [?]trick so meanly, so miserably reactive?</add></subst>. <del>Hard-<lb/>ly</del>, <del>I should think</del>: <subst><del>and</del> <add>But</add></subst> away <del>then</del> with all<lb/> pattering! Whatever cannot co-exist with entire<lb/> <del>intelligence</del> intellectual liberty and an unlimited<lb/> scope for Knowledge, progressively extending itself in<lb/> all directions, cannot be a true Finality&#x2014;and<lb/> should not, therefore, be laggardly rested in.</p>

<p rend="indent">And here a great Religious question arises:<lb/> Whether the genius of Romanism or of Protestan<add>t</add>ism,<lb/> be the more consonant with the foregoing views of<lb/> Finality? I answer, <add>[?]without [?]hesitation</add> the genius of the latter. The<lb/> tree of individual liberty, to be perfect, must put<lb/> forth an equal branch in every direction: hence the<lb/> exclusive education and pretensions of the Roman Priesthood<lb/> debar the bare possibility of them and it flourishing <del>healthf</del><lb/> healthily in the same field together. Do we not see<lb/> that whatever political cause they may ostensibly favor<lb/>&#x2014;whatever social or moral guise they may assume to<lb/> suit an <subst><del>exigency</del> <add>emergency, or to coincide with a popular movement</add></subst>, they have,
notwithstanding, but one<pb n="11" facs="C376/00000008.jpg"/> end in prospect&#x2014;the eventual <subst><del>predominance</del> <add>domination</add></subst> of their<lb/>Church! <add><del>not only [unclear] other church but</del></add> Whatever they may pretend to the contrary,<lb/> lay human beings, in their virtual estimation, are but<lb/> as so many stones, and their moral and material<lb/> powers but as so much mortar, whereby to build up<lb/> the edifice of their clerical authority: their political<lb/> trinity and social three-in-one being, in short,&#x2014;the<lb/> Church past,<del>&#x2014;</del> the Church present, and the Church to come;&#x2014;<lb/> the Church&#x2014;the Church&#x2014;the Church. They "live, move,<lb/> and have their being" in a certain <hi rend="ul">esprit du corpse</hi>, and<lb/> we may safely conclude of any profession that <subst><del>is</del> <add>may be</add></subst> thus <lb/>characterised, that <add>it</add> is opposed, as a whole, to the progressive<lb/> interests of Humanity. Add to this, that the blind<lb/> obedience which in the sphere of religion, they both teach<lb/> and enforce as far as they can, must be exceedingly<lb/> detrimental if not ruinous to <subst><del>a</del> <add><del>all</del></add> <add>all individual</add></subst>  <subst><del>free habit of thinking</del> <add>freedom of thought, as a moral<lb/> habit of mind,</add></subst> not in the line of such restriction only, but in every<lb/> other direction. Still their character is not inevitably<lb/> thus from the nature of humanity, but only because of a<lb/> superinduced perversity of it&#x2014;superinduced by their<lb/> system of Church government, and by their narrow,<lb/> pent up, dogmatical education. Let them be taught to<lb/> be men first&#x2014;enlightened, liberal men, and priests after-<lb/>wards; and then, perhaps, all would be well.</p>

<p rend="indent">Now Protestantism, on the other hand, is founded<lb/> on that very developement of individual consequence<lb/> which is to be our Governmental Finality, and which<lb/> progressively demands an extention in all directions of<lb/> individual <add>enlightenment and</add> liberty. Still mere Protestantism is <emph rend="ul">not</emph> the<lb/> Religious Finality&#x2014;and least of all Church and state    <pb n="12" facs="C376/00000009.jpg"/> Protestantism. Religion in the future will have to found itself<lb/> upon the nearest approach which can be made by it, in its<lb/> collective operancy, to an individual basis&#x2014;namely, a<lb/> congregational one: or continuing to strive against the<lb/> spirit of progress, it will be eventually trod<add>den</add> out by<lb/>it; that is, in its <del>collective [unclear]</del> public capacity, to<lb/> exist simply as a private tendency in the pious<lb/> hearts and unfailing consciences of men&#x2014;of men<lb/> religiously guided by, and amenable to God alone.</p>

<p rend="indent">The fundamental idea of Greece in her<lb/> palmiest days, was individual liberty, attaining unto<lb/> unity, by each subject and ruler being severally serviceable<lb/> to the national whole, with, at the same time, the perfect<lb/> retention on the part of each, of his own personal masterdom;<lb/> while the prime idea of all the great cumbrous Eastern<lb/> empires was unity by implicit obedience, endeavoured<lb/> after by <del>V</del> reducing the importance of individuals<lb/> into the mere units of a grand total, subjected to<lb/> one absolute ruling will. And regarded analogically,<lb/> just such such[sic] a political relation as the several<lb/> Grecian Republics <add>contradistinctively</add> bore to those Eastern despotisms,&#x2014;just<lb/> such a religious relation do the various Protestant<lb/> <subst><del>Sects</del> <add>communions</add></subst> bear <add>in opposition</add> to unity-boasting Romanism. Which<lb/> side then should we <subst><del>choose</del> <add>espouse</add></subst>, in our earnest desire after<lb/> some such Religious Finality as shall be perfectly in<lb/> concord with perfect Liberty?</p>

<p rend="indent">P.S. In the programme,&#x2014;or whatever else it may<lb/> be called, published lately by our Board of National<lb/> Education, it is stated, "The master, in all cases, must<lb/> be a man of Christian sentiments". Now who is to be<pb n="13" facs="C376/00000009.jpg"/> the Inquisitor on that head? Is it to be Romanist x x x<lb/> or church-of-England x x x, or whom? And how is a<lb/> right judgment of the Christianity of the applicant's<lb/> sentiments to be arrived at? Through the instrumentality<lb/> of thumb-screw or a Test-act,&#x2014;or how? Had they<lb/>written&#x2014;"The master, in all cases, must be a moral man<lb/> and of good social repute"&#x2014;that would have been rational.<lb/> But the sentimental requirement, as put forth from<lb/> such a position in these days, is purely a symtom<lb/> of intellectual flatulency, or of pietical pretence,<lb/> or of sectarian truckling!<add>&#x2014;or of all these ingredientially<lb/> compounded, after the mystical method of a quack medicine.</add></p></div>

<lg><l n="1">As in the death-like mystery of Sleep</l>
<l>My body lay impalled, my soul arose</l>
<l>And journeyed outward in a dream of wonder.</l>
<l>Methought that, in that voiceless midnight hour,</l>
<l>I roamed the margin of a waveless Lake,</l>
<l>Which, like a huge round dim Cyclopian eye</l>
<l>Welled in the knotted forehead of the Land,</l>
<l>Stared moodily heavenward; and that I had</l>
<l>Also a vague and mystic consciousness,</l>
<l>That over against me, on its further shore,</l>
<l>Which yet I might not see, there stood a Tower</l>
<l><del>[unclear]</del> Such as we read of in some old romance.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">The darkness darkened, until overhead</l>
<l>Solidly black the starless heaven<del>s</del> domed,</l>
<l>And earth was one <del>more</del> <add>wide</add> blank&#x2014;when suddenly</l>
<l>A Light, hung midway up the Tower, which I</l>
<l>Not seeing before, was conscious of, at once</l>
<l>Brought out its rounding structure from the gloom</l>
<l>Wherein, till now, it seemed substantially shut:</l>
<l>And as the Light then steadied, hanging there,</l>

<l>Suspended as by magic, I might see</l>

<l>My bodily weight seemed witched away, and up</l>
<l>I mounted, through the passive air,&#x2014;still up</l>

<l>So sweet conception,&#x2014;lo, a beautiful change!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Within a semi-circling balcony,</l>
<l>That midway up the Tower<del>,</del> emporched a huge</l>
<l>And brazen door, a Lady all of Light,</l>
<l>And lovelier than lustrous, stood alone;</l>
<l>And as she witched me tow'rds her, beckoned still</l>
<l>With tiny hand more splendid than a star:</l>
<l>Beckoned and smiled&#x2014;as Morning's streaky lips</l>
<l>Smile, reddening lengthwise, under and above</l>
<l>The pearly clouds; and with a voice intense</l>
<l>As the <del>quick glance</del> <add>first sense</add> of <del>dying</del> <add>new-born</add> bliss, and oh!</l>
<l>More silvery than the radiance of the Moon,</l>
<l>When from some promontory looking out</l>
<l>Over the Ocean,&#x2014;she kept asking aye,</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">I heard&#x2014;but felt</l>
<l>Pass from me then a cry of instant fear,</l>
<l>As swooning with intensity of joy,</l>
<l>Methought I drifted&#x2014;wither? All was now</l>
<l>One wide cold blank, the drearier for that</l>
<l>A gleam of dizzy and clinging consciousness</l>
<l>Kept flickering from mine inmost pulse of life,</l>
<l>Like a far meteor in some dismal marsh:&#x2014;</l>
<l>How long I dreamt not&#x2014;but the thrilling warmth,</l>

<pb n="34" facs="C376/00000020.jpg"/>

<l>Which, like the new birth of a passionate love,</l>
<l>Erewhile had pierced me to the heart, again</l>
<l><del>Tingled</del> <add>Shuddered</add> within it&#x2014;more and more, until</l>
<l>Mine eyes had opened under two that made</l>
<l>All else like darkness; and upon my cheek</l>
<l>A breath that seemed the final spirit of all</l>
<l>Life holds of sweetness, harbingered once more</l>
<l>The fond enquiry of that <del>silvery</del> <add>silver</add> voice,</l>
<l>Which to have heard was never to forget&#x2014;</l>
<l>"Where hast thou stayed so long?"</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">I answered not,</l>
<l>But followed <del>her</del> in mute love her starry eyes</l>
<l>With<del>in</del> mine, as on that balcony against</l>
<l>The brazen door, <del>methought I now reclined</del> <add>close at her lustrous side</add>,</l>
<l><del>Close at her lustrous side</del> <add>Methought I now reclined</add>, upon a couch</l>
<l>Of purple, looking forth. Nor did I marvel</l>
<l>As hers thus led my vision, to remark</l>
<l>That the broad Lake, with its green shelving shores</l>
<l>Swarming with flowers, or draped with vines, and thence</l>
<l>The prospect all,&#x2014;hills, skies, and winding vales,</l>
<l>And bloomy woods of an unspeakable beauty,</l>
<l>Were sleeping in the radiance of a day</l>
<l>More blessedly serene, than ever yet</l>

<pb n="35" facs="C376/00000020.jpg"/>

<l>Might so enrobe the common world of man,</l>
<l>Since Paradise was lost.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">I saw all this</l>
<l>Surpassing beauty&#x2014;but I saw it still</l>
<l>Through her superior life, her moon-like sphere</l>
<l>Of being, that seemed <del>transpicuously the</del> <add>the inexhaustible</add> scource[sic]&#x2014;</l>
<l>(<del>The inexhaustible source</del> <add>Transpicuously evinced</add>) of breathing thoughts</l>

<l>And earnest tenderness, than many hearts</l>
<l>Of the most fervent daughters of mankind</l>
<l>United might possess;&#x2014;all interflowing</l>
<l>From the fine issues of a love at once</l>
<l>Wilful and nice, but, therefore, not the less</l>
<l>Sanctioned by its own purity. Nor might</l>
<l>The brimming Lake below<add>,</add><del>,</del> then give the print</l>
<l>More quickly of the wind's invisible steps,</l>
<l>Than instant tokens of communion sweet</l>
<l>With the rare soul of outward beauty, passed</l>
<l>Into her eyes, to make the eloquent whole</l>
<l>Of her bright countenance alive with bliss.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">But as upon the wonder of her beauty</l>
<l>My soul now feasted, even till it seemed</l>
<l>Instinct with kindred lustre,&#x2014;to[sic], her looks</l>

<pb n="36" facs="C376/00000021.jpg"/>

<l>Suddenly saddened, and abstractedly</l>
<l>Outfixing them as on some far wild thought</l>
<l>That darkened then over our peace, she flung</l>
<l>Her silver voice into a mystic song</l>
<l>Of many measures, gathering as they went</l>
<l>Into a sliding flood of glorious verse,</l>
<l>Sweetly abundant! And with this, as still</l>
<l>She poured it out, invisible Singers mixed</l>
<l>A choral burthen that <del>in concord so</del> <add>prolonged the strain's</add></l>
<l><del>Prolonged it</del> <add>Rich concords.</add>, till the echoes of the hills</l>
<l>Came forth in turn, and refluently afar</l>
<l>Blent all into one mystery of sound,</l>

<lg><l>She ceased; and a deep tingling silence fell</l>
<l>Instantly round: silence complete, and yet</l>
<l>Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left</l>
<l>By the rare spirit of her voice, now hushed:</l>
<l>Even as the fragrance of an exquisite flower</l>
<l>Is felt in the mute air through which erewhile</l>
<l>It hath been carried by the loving hand</l>
<l>Of some <del>sweeted</del> sweet-thoughted Maiden. Turning then</l>
<l>Her bright face tow'rds me, as I stood entranced,</l>
<l>Yet wonder-stung, she said:</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">"I love thee, yes<del>s</del>;</l>
<l>But oh, even Love&#x2014;this purple-wing&#x00EB;d Love,</l>
<l>Is but a honey-bee of Paradise,</l>
<l>That seldom strays into the common world</l>
<l>Of Man and Woman; and even then, <del>alas!</del> <add>'tis only</add></l>
<l><del>'Tis only</del> <add>Wildly and</add> wilfully wandering from the home</l>
<l>Of its pure birth, whither it must return</l>
<l>Ere the night cometh." And with these, her eyes</l>
<l>Ran o'er with lustres as they opened up</l>
<l>Under mine own now melancholy gaze.</l></lg>

<pb n="39" facs="C376/00000022.jpg"/>

<lg><l rend="indent1">And so we stood, turned one unto the other,</l>
<l>Till love again grew glad, even from the rich</l>
<l>And wine-like luxury of its own tears.</l>
<l><del>And</del> <add>Forth then</add> we looked <del>forth</del> once more,&#x2014;happily silent.</l>
<l>Alas! not long: for with a short low gasp</l>
<l>Of sudden fear, she started; nor might I</l>
<l>Stand unalarmed. For hark! within the Tower</l>
<l>A sound of strenuous steps<del>,</del> approaching fast,</l>
<l>Rung upward as it seemed from the hard pavement</l>
<l>Of a steep winding stair; and soon the huge</l>
<l>And brazen <del>door</del> <add>portal</add> that <del>shut</del> behind us <del>there</del> <add>shut</add>,</l>
<l>Burst open! with a clang of loosened bolts&#x2014;</l>
<l>A clang like thunder, that went rattling forth</l>
<l>Against the echoes of the distant hills.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">With deafened ears<del>,</del> and ghasted eyes, I had turned</l>
<l>Tow'rds the harsh noise, there to behold, between</l>
<l>The brazen jambs in the Tower-wall<del>,</del> from which</l>
<l>The door swung inward, a tremendous Form!</l>
<l>A horrid gloomy Form, that shapeless seemed,</l>
<l>And yet in its deformity of bulk</l>
<l>A hideous likeness bare to Man! Still more</l>
<l>Deformed it grew<del>,</del> as forth it swelled; and then</l>
<l>Its outlines, shadowing outwards, so were lost</l>
<l>In a dim indistinguishable haze</l>

<pb n="40" facs="C376/00000023.jpg"/>

<l>That hung around them, ev<del>e</del><add>'</add>n as dull grey clouds</l>
<l>Beskirt a coming Tempest, dark itself,</l>
<l>And murkiest in midst.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">The Lady of Light</l>
<l>Had rushed to my extended arms<del>,</del> and hid</l>
<l>Her beamy face, fright-harrowed, in my bosom!</l>
<l>And thus we stood, made one in fear; <del>and</del> <add>while</add> still</l>
<l>That grisly Form glared out upon us&#x2014;glared</l>
<l>With horny eyes, the horrider for that</l>
<l>No touch of passion vitalized their fixed</l>
<l>Cold stare, as tow'rds some destined task they seemed</l>
<l>To guide its pitiless strength.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">With one dark stride</l>
<l>Then glooming forward, and extending straight</l>
<l>One shadowy arm, from my reluctant grasp</l>
<l>It tore the Radiant Girl, muttering the while</l>
<l>"This is forbidden!" in a voice, the tones</l>
<l>Of which were like low thunder, as 'tis heard</l>
<l>Outroaming from the rugged-winding glens</l>
<l>Of neighbouring mountains: and as suddenly,</l>
<l>Seized by the other, I was backward thrown</l>
<l>Within the Tower, and heard, ere I could rise</l>
<l>From the cold pavement, the huge brazen <del>leaves[?]</del> door</l>

<pb n="41" facs="C376/00000023.jpg"/>

<l>Drawn to upon me<del>,</del> and its bolts all <del>short</del> shot</l>
<l>Into their sockets with a thundrous jar!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">I may not paint the horrible despair</l>
<l>That froze me now. I listened; all was still!</l>
<l>Without,&#x2014;within,&#x2014;all silent, stirless, cold!</l>
<l>What was my doom? And where was she, my late</l>
<l>So luminous delight? Gone&#x2014;gone! And I</l>
<l>For some all-unimaginable cause,</l>
<l>A dungeoned wretch! Time, every <del>drop</del> <add>cold drip</add> of which</l>
<l>Was as an age, kept <del>tingling</del> <add>trickling</add> on, but there</l>
<l>Brought no release&#x2014;no hope&#x2014;not even a breath</l>
<l>That spake of life beyond myself. I stood</l>
<l><add>In <del>icy [unclear]</del> marble-cold astonishment of heart,</add></l>
<l>Utterly blank. And when at length I cast</l>
<l>A desperate glance,&#x2014;so desperate, that <del>it</del> the power</l>
<l>Of vision stung me like a deadly curse,&#x2014;</l>
<l>Up and around; in pity of myself</l>
<l>I wept <del>aloud</del>: till resignation, that <add>most sweet</add></l>
<l>Meek flower of grief which hath its root in tears,</l>
<l>Grew out of mine, and with it, strength of will</l>
<l>To inspect my Prison.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">'Twas a lofty Cell,</l>
<l>Half round, and had a second door<add>,</add><del>,</del> embossed</l>
<l>With iron studs, which might have opened in</l>
<l>Athwart the stairway (as I guessed) that led</l>
<l>Down through the Tower; and by the side of this</l>

<pb n="42" facs="376/00000024.jpg"/>

<l>A massive stead upon four dragon claws</l>
<l>Stood naked, with a tripod placed before it.</l>
<l>Bare too, and dull, were the rude walls, but pierced</l>
<l>High out of reach<del>,</del> by two small ports<del>,</del> that looked</l>
<l>One east, one westward.&#x2014;As I noted these,</l>
<l>Full on my sight a transcient sunbeam fell</l>
<l>Slantlingly through, and in my heart I guessed</l>
<l>That tow'rds the mountain tops the sun was then</l>
<l>Rapidly sloping.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">By degrees the night</l>
<l>Came on, and the Cell darkened: yea, I saw</l>
<l>The stead and tripod&#x2014;all its furniture,</l>
<l>Fade gradually, melting more and more</l>
<l>Into the darkness; even as a fish,</l>
<l>Through the dense medium of its element</l>
<l>Retiring down, is in its outlines seen</l>
<l>More shadowy&#x2014;till 'tis lost. Then all was black.</l>
<l>And to and fro I paced, hour after hour,</l>
<l>And heard my step, the only sound to me</l>
<l>In the wide world, reverb with a dull blow</l>
<l>Down through the hollow Tower<add>,</add><del>,</del> that seemed to yawn</l>
<l>Immeasurably beneath! Hour after hour;</l>
<l>And still no other sound was living there!</l>
<l>But I grew sensible at length, methought</l>

<pb n="43" facs="376/00000024.jpg"/>

<l>Of seasonable change;&#x2014;that now the Cell</l>
<l>Kept clarifying, till the darkness seemed</l>
<l>Marbled with grey: and then the stead again,</l>
<l>And tripod, figured indistinctly through</l>
<l>The thinning gloom, and gradually thence</l>
<l>Came forth in full definement, by the same</l>
<l>Degrees reversed as they faded in it.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">It was the Dawn: and thus it clearing kept,</l>
<l>Till through the eastern port a golden rod</l>
<l>Of light came transciently, and so bespake</l>
<l>The sunrise! Oh! it was a desolate pass,</l>
<l>To feel,&#x2014;immured in that so deadly place,</l>
<l>That the great Sun was then upon the hills</l>
<l>Rejoicing in his glory! Then to know</l>
<l>That he was wheeling up the heavens, and o'er</l>
<l>My dungeon-roof:&#x2014;hour after hour, to think</l>
<l>That he was filling with a step of fire</l>
<l>His midway circle, and thence steeping down</l>
<l>Into the west! But this was my dire fate,</l>
<l>While seven times came and <del>[unclear]</del> went the day; and yet</l>
<l>I slept not; nor did hunger pinch me there,</l>
<l>Nor thirst inflame. Mere wonder at my doom</l>
<l>Relieved despair.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">But on the seventh night, hark!</l>

<pb n="44" facs="C376/00000025.jpg"/>

<l>What might I hear?&#x2014;a step?&#x2014;a light small step</l>
<l>Ascending by the stair! Swiftly it came</l>
<l>Straight to the inner door&#x2014;then paused. When hark!</l>
<l>Another? yea, the same big-beating tramp</l>
<l>That once I had heard before, came following fast!</l>
<l>Approached&#x2014;and then, a low sad cry without</l>
<l>Went to my heart, and I might hear ensue</l>
<l>A struggle as of one forced down the stair</l>
<l>By that so pitiless Guard!&#x2014;down, till the Tower</l>
<l>Once more was still. But not for long! again</l>
<l>The Monster's hateful tread came booming up&#x2014;</l>
<l>Up to the door! It opened; and he stood</l>
<l>Full in its darkened space: but ere the Fiend</l>
<l>Might enter further, rage and hate at once</l>
<l>Possessed me, and I charged him! For a space</l>
<l>His terrible glooms involved me; but, methought,</l>
<l>I burst with irresistible strength away!</l>
<l>Rushed through the door, and down the stair,&#x2014;down, down</l>
<l>An endless depth, till a portcullis, hinged</l>
<l>In the Tower's basement, opened to my flight.</l>
<l>No sooner had I passed it, than it fell</l>
<l>In thunder <del>too</del> to! and thence my passage lay</l>
<l>Along the difficult ledges of a rock</l>
<l>Bordering the Lake.</l></lg>

<pb n="45" facs="C376/00000025.jpg"/>

<lg><l type="half">And when at length I had paused</l>
<l>In that so giddy flight, methought I saw</l>
<l>The Lady of Light up midway in the air</l>
<l>Ascending, with a downward look on me</l>
<l>Of parting recognition,&#x2014;full of love,</l>
<l>But painless, passionless. Upward she passed,</l>
<l>Above the Tower, and o'er the clouds,&#x2014;and when</l>
<l>Her radiance melted through the marble cope</l>
<l>Of heaven, and left it vacant in its vastness,</l>
<l>A sense of loss fell on me, all so wide</l>
<l>And bitterly desolate, that I awoke!</l>
<l>Awoke, to find it but a dream of wonder.</l>
<l>Yet ever since to feel as though some pure</l>
<l>And guardian Thing, out of the day and night,</l>
<l>Had passed forever from the reach of Love.</l></lg></div>

<l>That Shelley's solemn bursts, and gushing gladness,</l>

<pb n="48" facs="C376/00000027.jpg"/>

<l>That Wordsworth was a dolt! and Coleridge worse!</l>
<l>And Hunt's most dainty hand, so skilled to nurse</l>
<l>Young truths of Song&#x2014;but fit to cut a purse!</l>
<l>That Keats was <subst><del>quite an idiot</del> <add>a mere driveller</add></subst>! and poor White</l>
<l>Strangely misled in thinking he could write!</l>
<l>That though an exquisite so much in vogue,</l>
<l>Bulwer's strong passion for a dashing rogue,</l>
<l>Were low his sphere, would passing soon afford</l>
<l>Himself the glory of a "penny cord!"</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But on the other hand, I'm told, that wit</l>

<l>Or that the Northern Bard, whose antique dress</l>

<p><del>1848</del>. When I spoke in the Text of Hunt's "most<lb/> dainty hand", it strikes me <emph rend="ul">now</emph>, that it must have<lb/> been more with reference to his poetical criticism, than<lb/> to his poetry:&#x2014;though <add>even</add> this, <del>for the most part</del>, is <add>very often</add> as<lb/> dainty and sweet, and beautifully loveable as<lb/> youthful womanhood. But in a certain genial,<lb/> delicate, racy appreciation<del>s</del> of the spells, and golden<lb/> veins, and "spic&#x00EB;d airs" of the writings of other men<lb/> of genius,&#x2014;men after his own large heart and <subst><del>earnest</del>  <add>believing</add></subst><pb n="50" facs="C376/00000028.jpg"/> imagination,&#x2014;he has <add>to my thinking, but</add> few equals, <del>and, to my<lb/> thinking, no superior</del>. [BEGIN NOT CORRECTED] And he can set all this<lb/> forth in a prose style that is <del n="1">as mean perfection<lb/> in its structure and bloom</del> <del n="2">in</del> <add><unclear>in both its structure and bloom, any<lb/> character and structure perfect</unclear></add>, as the lovely Miss L. is in<lb/> her face and figure. [Still he has a critical failing -<lb/>not in his style, but in his kind of  discriminativeness.<lb/> He is too nice: that is to say, he is too prone to point out <lb/>in his favourite poems, as    artistical proprietess, certain<lb/> alliterative and other minute felicities, which so far <lb/>from being designed <add><unclear>were never, it is probable, even so much as perceived</unclear></add> by their Authors themselves, <lb/><del>were never, it is probable, even so much as <add>consciously</add> perceived <lb/>by them: and this his</del> critical petting of the like, <lb/>may lead in the future to a <del>good</del> <add>vast</add> deal of <lb/>disquisi <del><unclear/></del> <add>tional</add> trifling and poetical foppery. In <lb/>other words, this nicety approximates so <del><unclear/></del> nearly <lb/>to an abuse in Hunt himself, that it is perilously <lb/>likely to occasion <del>it</del> <add>an over fastidiousness</add> in his critical imitators,- and <lb/>he is sure to have many such; and also in the <lb/>poetical imitators of the authors he has so <lb/>super-subtlitely criticised. <ref target="C376-00000028">*</ref></p>

<p>The verdict in the Text, on the Muse of <lb/>Sir Walter Scott, <del>I doubt not, will startle many:</del> <add><unclear>will no doubt be doubted by many</unclear></add> <lb/><del>yet</del> <add>still</add> I believe it to be, in the main, a just one. <lb/>With much of the fire and strength of poetic <del>al</del> <lb/>genius, he had scarcely anything of its ideal <lb/>subtlety and grace. <del>Homer, though</del> He could out- <lb/>-line the poetical face of things correctly enough, <pb n="51" facs="C37600000028.jpg"/> <add>but</add> the spiritual expression,- the "living soul" of it escaped <lb/>him. And when his Poems are apparently brightest, <lb/>they are so, like the waters of a shallow stream, from <lb/>their very want of depth.
 <note xml:id="C376-00000028">Take away the proper names, and the <lb/>merely local associations, and his <del>poems</del>        <add>ballad epics</add> ,- even the best of them,- <del>are</del> <add>were</add> but so many picked <lb/>bones.</note></p>

<p>The sneer at Southey is hardly just. Certainly, <lb/>his poetical metal was such as to require much "hammering" <lb/>to work it into shape - but it was not of mere iron. <lb/>The truth is, Southey has written several great Poems;- <lb/>great in learning; great in imagination; great in <lb/>structure, like the Pyramids, but cold and passionless as <lb/>they, and with as little universality of human reference. <lb/>They want that breath of life, and vitality of purpose,<lb/>without which the Ideal even in Poetry, is <add>only</add> of a piece <lb/>with mere statuary or mere painting. Such, upon <lb/>the whole, is the character of his Poetry. ["But his <lb/>prose is perfect," said Byron: and it is nearly so. <lb/>It is elaborately finished, and ponderously musical; <lb/>and yet, unlike Johnson's, it is "native to the soil." <lb/>In fact, it is the olden English prose style, somewhat <lb/>modernised, but not at all Frenchified; nor rendered <lb/>too colloquial: that style in which a too great elision <lb/>of the <del><unclear/></del> auxiliary parts of speech is even studiously <lb/>avoided; and doubtless a too rigid cashiering of those <lb/>little but helpful unities of language is had in prose. <lb/>It proceeds from and indicates, I think, in the persons <lb/>over attached to it, a parsimonious organ of Language, <lb/>and also of Tune. [The prose style of the whole <pb n="52" facs="C376/00000029.jpg"/> "mob of gentleman who wrote with ease" in English some <lb/>century ago, has a remarkably shorn appearance in <lb/>consequence of a too finnicking addiction to this species <lb/>of phrase-paring. They indeed, followed it out, <lb/>to a man, even to the extent of grammatical obscurity. <lb/>In poetry much liberty of this kind of elision is <lb/>necessarily and gracefully allowable. For instance, in <lb/>the often quoted line, "From grave to gay, from lively <lb/>to severe," the definite article, though not used at <lb/>all, is understood to be in no less than four places. <lb/>In prose the sentence would stand thus: "From <hi rend="ul">the</hi> <lb/>grave to <hi rend="ul">the</hi> gay, from <hi rend="ul">the</hi> lively to <hi rend="ul">the</hi> severe"; <lb/>and <hi rend="ul">as prose</hi> , it would be all the better - all the <lb/>more musical for the repetition of the article in <lb/>each of these several places. Such at least is my <lb/>opinion, and such also, judging from his practice, <lb/>would have been Southey's.[END NOT CORRECTED]</p>

<l>Into a deep and <subst><del>dusky</del> <add>gloomy</add></subst> Glen</l>
<l>The mountain track descended:</l>
<l>A gloomy Glen that far was seen</l>
<l>Winding hugely on between</l>
<l>Two craggy rampires<del>,</del> stained in face</l>
<l>With many a tempest's wrath&#x2014;</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">And now the sought-for Grave I found.&#x2014;</l>
<l>Against me stretched, its lonely mound</l>

<l>Darkly, save as the last long blade</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">And thinking thus of him who slept</l>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. I have called property in this Poem an emptier <add>imposition</add><lb/> than even the accident of high birth; and such, I repeat<lb/> in prose, it assuredly is, when made the direct qualification<lb/> to political or social power of any kind: because the latter,<lb/> though in itself more questionable, is yet oftener the<lb/> antecedent to at least a passable education. Otherwise,<lb/> though I account great inequalities of property as amongst<lb/> the greatest evils of society, I hold, at the same time,<lb/> that the only means for the smoothing down of these,<lb/> which can be safely entrusted to any governing power,<lb/> are the preclusion of entails and laws of primogeniture.<lb/> The individual's right to possess and enjoy whatever<lb/> wealth he may lawfully inherit or acquire, must ever<lb/> remain at the foundation of a sound social system;<lb/> for in no other way could it secure to its members that<lb/> individuality of will, which is the very keystone of<lb/> social,&#x2014;nay, of all liberty. This prime necessity of<lb/> society is fatal, then, to the Owenian or socialist philosophy.</p>

<p rend="indent">I was once somewhat smitten by the apparent<lb/> benevolence of Owen's views, but a further observation<lb/> of human character, in its individual tendencies, has<pb n="73" facs="C376/00000040.jpg"/> led me to prefer the frame-work of almost any existing<lb/> form of community, to that monotonous series of mere<lb/> physical harmonies, which his system would be only<lb/> calculated to elicit, age after age, even from the<lb/> aggregated union of all our social energies; because<lb/> such a regimental sort of unity would emasculate them<lb/> in the same degree, of all personal freedom of will,<lb/> and consequently of all true moral glory. In fine, I<lb/> can see nothing to covet in a dead social level after<lb/> the Chinese pattern, however it might be smoothed into<lb/> a painless perfection by the superior arts and appliances<lb/> of European civilization.</p>

<p rend="indent">As to the "jar of customary wrongs" becoming<lb/> daily harsher to the "ear of Thought",&#x2014;of this, I would<lb/> say, the signs are manifold. At a meeting of intelligent<lb/> working men not long since in that happy country, England,<lb/> held to remonstrate against certain persecutions they had<lb/> undergone at the hands of their fox-hunting "pastors and<lb/> masters (as the church catecism has it), one of the<lb/> speakers put the matter in the following unsophisticated<lb/> yet irrefutable form: "Why, in a free country, and amongst<lb/> free men, should any subject be <emph rend="ul">tabooed</emph>? Why should any<lb/> man be molested for freely using that reason which God has<lb/> given him for his moral and intellectual guidance?" But<lb/> the logic of cant would put down the honest intelligence<lb/> of this noble son of toil, by quoting, it is likely, the<lb/> saying of Solomon, "He that encreaseth knowledge en-<lb/>=creaseth sorrow", with this <emph rend="ul">compassionate</emph> conclusion<lb/> tacked to the end of it: "Therefore the many, to be able<pb n="74" facs="C376/00000041.jpg"/> to bear with life at all, must leave it to the few<lb/> who make them poor laws and sermons. On the<lb/> other side, the logic of the aristocratical colleges<lb/> would make a similar dictum the polished apex of<lb/> of[sic] a more elaborate disquisition upon popular happiness;<lb/> thereby proving, however, as our hard-fisted orator above<lb/> quoted would certainly aver, altogether too much,&#x2014;<lb/> namely, that men collectively may become too wise,<lb/> or that it is the final nature of knowledge to<lb/> impugn and deprave itself! But the day of<lb/> Bible cant and learned imposition is palpably drawing<lb/> to its close in the past, and that of absolute free=<lb/>=dom as evidently dawning from the future.</p></div>

A man<lb/> with a forehead thus constituted, however versed in<lb/> logic, will often mistake an apparant difference<lb/> or similarity for a real one. He, on the contrary,<lb/> whose Wit is large, or even full only, will never do so.<lb/> He distinguishes at a glance&#x2014;intuitively&#x2014;the real<lb/> from the apparent in this respect, however approximate.<lb/> In fine, Paley's forehead, I think, had just that sort<lb/> of configuration which would make a keen professional<lb/> man of talent without one golden ray of genius.<lb/> "What he did see", says D<hi rend="ss">r</hi>.

<div type="poem">

<head type="title">Whatever is, is Right(?)</head>

<lg><l n="1">When Pope declared, Whatever Is, is Right,</l>
<l>Had he been whipped until he bled,</l>
<l>Then salved with his own words in merry spite,</l>
<l>I wonder what he <emph rend="ul">could</emph> have said?</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. The above doctrine of Pope is about as exquisite an<lb/> absurdity as ever was written. It is even worse than<lb/> absurd, being an arrant piece of moral quietism. It is<lb/> even worse again than moral quietism, being a justification<lb/> as well as a toleration of any and every kind of existing<lb/> abuse. Were it indeed the great obvious Truth <del>which</del><lb/> that he proclaims it to be, it were no matter whatsoever<lb/> [unclear] might do; because, when done, it would be only a<pb n="83" facs="C376/00000045.jpg"/> part of <emph rend="ul">whatever is</emph>, and consequently <emph rend="ul">right.</emph> <add>True, there would be<lb/> the same argument for whatever might be done counterfactively. But this <subst><del>would be</del> <add>were</add></subst> only <add>to</add> confess<del>ing</del><lb/> and prolong<del>ing</del> the absurdity.</add></p>

<p rend="indent">A similar fallacy lies couched in the saying,<lb/> The Powers that Be are of God. Of course he permits them<lb/> or they could not be. He may sanction them, but he does not<lb/> directly institute them. They are, in their origin, the probational<lb/> structures of men, though obtaining both in their beginning<lb/> and continuance, by the Divine sanction or sufferance: and<lb/> they may, therefore, be either morally right or morally wrong,<lb/> or partake more or less of both conditions. If right,<lb/> God favors them; if wrong, he suffers them: because the<lb/> highest public heroism can only be mightily evinced by<lb/> their counter existence. The powers that be are of God,<lb/> then, only <add>in</add> so far as they co-exist with his moral government<lb/> of the world;&#x2014;permissively, if bad, for the
oppositional<lb/> exercise of public virtue; and by favor or adoption, if<lb/> good, as the highest result of it. Hence, as it is noble<lb/> to obey all just laws, and to support all righteous rule, so<lb/> is it not only <subst><del>lawful</del> <add>optional</add></subst>, but meritorious, to resist and subvert,<lb/> if possible, all flagrant and mischievous authority.</p></div>

<l>Of Manhood,&#x2014;and of Truth's effectual Friend.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. No habitually crafty<add>,&#x2014;no sinuously designing</add> man can ever be intrinsically<pb n="84" facs="C376/00000046.jpg"/> wise or great;&#x2014;can ever be a hero in the unvulgar and<lb/> <subst><del>morally authentic significancy</del> 
<add>rational sense</add></subst> of the term. Much of the<lb/> reason wherefore is obvious. By a bias of heart and<lb/> intellect, either innate or superinduced by education, such a<lb/> man will always prefer the crooked to the straight;<lb/> the specious to the truthful; the subtleties of art to the<lb/> simplicities of nature.</p>

<p rend="indent">And this crafty bias, renders at length, even<lb/> our mere perceptiveness over-cunning and self-deceptions<lb/> /so to speak/. Hence the profoundest mistakers of moral<lb/> causes are the super-subtle of both sexes; <del>for the reason</del>,<lb/> <del>that</del> they are always disposed to dive deeper after the<lb/> principles of our <subst><del>nature</del> <add>conduct</add></subst> than there is any occasion for.<lb/> The cork that floats on the surface, and the pebble that<lb/> sinks below, are equally sought for by such gentry<lb/> <emph rend="ul">in the</emph> <del>[unclear]</del> <emph rend="ul">mud</emph> <emph rend="ul">at the bottom</emph>.</p>

<p rend="indent">Simple directness of nature is even in Things, as well<lb/> as in Men, the prime characteristic of real greatness&#x2014;of<lb/> effectual truthfulness. Whatever is circuitous, no matter how it<lb/> may be pretexed by expediency, is always more or less fraudulent&#x2014;<lb/> or merely specious at the best. Hence no System of religion<lb/> can be the true one&#x2014;can be wholly of God, which sanctions,<lb/> or even permits, but one pious fraud:&#x2014;<del>in other words</del>,<lb/> one subterfuge, either for its maintenance or propagation.<lb/> Nor can the man be other than an impostor, who<lb/> adheres to such a System for a moment after he<lb/> has become aware of the fact, that it does sanction,<lb/> or even countenance, any dishonesty of the kind.</p></div>

<p rend="indent">At a meeting of laborers the other day in England, held under the wide<lb/> cold heaven of a winter's night,&#x2014;for their employers had denied them even the<lb/> shelter of a barn,&#x2014;and at which the hunger-bitten speakers read their resolutions<lb/> by the light of a morsel of candle held in the "cauld <del>[unclear]</del> hand" of each, like the<lb/> corpses in Tam o'Shanter galvanised for the occasion;&#x2014;at this ghastly<lb/> meeting, a poor woman gave her sense of Free Trade in these words:

<p rend="indent">My notions and tastes may be peculiar, but I have small<lb/> patience, <subst><del>and as little respect for</del> <add>with</add></subst>, overmuch prudence in love, and<lb/> as little relish for a cold passion as for cold soup.

And<lb/> secondly, if she valued me much, despite the chilling admonitions<lb/> of her mere prudence /as I believe she did/, there is at least so much<lb/> against the self-referent wisdom of her conduct, in finally rejecting<lb/> me.</p>

<p rend="indent">I write this Note in the spirit of regret&#x2014;not of complaint.<lb/> Nor <add>can</add> she <emph rend="ul">now</emph>, <del>can</del> have aught to complain of.

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. It is somewhat singular <add>to observe</add> that, not only the lost<lb/> love-pleads, but the wives as well, of the greatest modern<lb/> British Poets, have been nearly all <emph rend="ul">Marys</emph>. Coleridge's<lb/> wife was a Mary. So was Shelley's. So also is Wordsworth's,<lb/> if she be yet living. Then there was Byron's Mary, his first<lb/> love, in memory of whom he wrote, many years afterwards, when<lb/> his "heart was as grey as his head", the following beautifully<lb/> pathetic verses:</p>

<q>
<lg><l>"I have a passion for the Name of Mary,</l>
<l>For once it was a majic sound to me;</l>
<l>And yet it half recals the world of Faery,</l>
<l>Wherein I dreamt of what might never be."</l></lg>
</q>

<p rend="indent">Lastly, /not to mention the fact of its being the "one<lb/> loved name" of the majority of our Sonneteers and song-writers/<lb/> there was Burns' never-to-be-forgotten Highland Mary: she whose<lb/> insphered spirit, in its earthward effusion, kept yearning<lb/> through the inspirations of her yet mortal lover, even as the<lb/> reflexion of the morning star <subst><del>[unclear]</del> <add>is seen</add></subst> dilating within the wild<lb/> waters of some mountain Lake,&#x2014;large and lamping, though<lb/> so deep-down and distant;&#x2014;and whouse untimely death<lb/> and burial suggested the following, the most sacredly sorrow-<lb/>=ful stanza in the world! <del>Not even the weeping statue of<lb/> Niobe in</del> How beautiful is it too!&#x2014;how perfect! Not even the<lb/> weeping statue of Niobe is more faultlessly proportioned in its<lb/> artistic means&#x2014;the pathetic arrangement of its circumstances;<lb/> and yet how native to the unlabored soil of our common<lb/> humanity is <add>the whole of</add> it?&#x2014;what a simple wild flower of thought and feeling!</p>

<q>
<lg><l>"O pale, pale now those ruby lips</l>
<l>I aft hae kissed sae fondly;</l>
<l>And closed for aye the sparkling glance</l>
<l>That dwelt on me sae kindly;</l>
<l>And mouldering now in silent dust</l>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. Several things held valuable in these verses, <subst><del>seth</del> <add>saith</add></subst> that most<lb/> self-circumspective moral negation, the <del>[unclear]</del> square-and-compass Utilitarian,<lb/> are only fancifully so&#x2014;particularly the Graves, however large=<lb/>=looking in the Text by virtue of an arbitary Capital: all the best<lb/> kind of which articles, possessed by any people of the nineteenth<lb/> century, were capitally exchanged for one capital railroad,<lb/> or the capital requisite for its construction!</p>

<p rend="indent">But he is wrong, wise as he is: they <del>would</del> were<lb/> not. The prime object of Society is, or should be, the per=<lb/>=fection of Man; not the multiplication of the physical<lb/> conveniences of life, which are of value only in so far as<lb/> they also <subst><del>conserve</del> <add>conduce to</add></subst> that object. In other words, fine<lb/> human beings are its end, and all other fine things,<lb/> properly employed, but its means to that end. And<lb/> fifty Graves therefore, containing the ashes of as many<lb/> truly illustrious Men /not mere Prince Alberts/ were a<lb/> richer inheritance to any people, for all time, than even<lb/> <emph rend="ul">twice</emph> that number of railroads /in lieu/, with an equal<lb/> tally of steamers given in, to boot the bargain. For they<lb/> were the pious altars of its paternal mentality: they were<lb/> the sacred landmarks of <del>his</del> its moral progress: they were<pb n="104" facs="C376/00000056.jpg"/> the oracular shrines of its spirit-communion with the<lb/> glory of the future!</p>

<p rend="indent">Beyond clearing him out of the way thus far,<lb/> however, I am not at all disposed to meddle with<lb/> Master Utility. In calculating the interest tables, con-<lb/>-structing the baking ovens&#x2014;and eke the railroads of<lb/> social life, he is laboring commendably, and only becomes<lb/> a Charlatan when he would theorise the Rule of Three into<lb/> a providential type of the mysterious microcosm, Man<lb/> himself; with its unfathomable depths and probational<lb/> shoals of thought and passion&#x2014;its unpathed wildernesses<lb/>of poesy&#x2014;its mighty mountains of impassable will&#x2014;<lb/> its pyramids of suffering and monuments of fate!</p>

<p rend="indent">Precarious then in its moral results as society<lb/> may be at present, still we must not endeavour,<lb/> for the mere sake of a selfish safety, to saw it up<lb/> into a sort of animal clockwork, such as the<lb/> Chinese system of community superinduces and<lb/> perpetuates&#x2014;for who out of the <emph rend="ul">Celestial</emph> Empire should<lb/> <del>[unclear]</del> rejoice at such a consummation? In<lb/> overstepping the narrow proverbial morality, and tame<lb/> social parallelism, of even a Franklin, we are often<lb/> obeying, I believe, far higher laws than those we transgress,<lb/> and working out results which, though not dreamt of<lb/> in Paley, are yet projecting the finalities of our being<lb/> into another and a mightier world: the ampler exercise<lb/> our whole nature hath in this life, fitting us no doubt<lb/> for a commensurately enlarged spirituality in the<pb n="105" facs="C376/00000056.jpg"/> next. It operates also, transmissively, to the<lb/> developement of a fuller general capacity in our posterity.<lb/> And hence, even poverty, with its inevitable trouble and<lb/> heart-suffering, if <add><emph rend="ul">educated</emph>, and thence</add> productive of a philosophical spirirt of<lb/> thought and feeling, is infinitely a more prizeable thing<lb/> than that sure worldly prosperity, the most obvious tendency<lb/> of which is to fatten men, and even <emph rend="ul">women</emph>, into<lb/> uneatable bacon.</p>

<p><add>I will annex some blank lines, on account<lb/> of their spiritual agreement with the general tenor<lb/> of this Note. They were originally published in Duncan's<lb/> Weekly Register under the Title of "a Great Truth<lb/> little understood".</add></p></div>

<l rend="indent">On something unchanged since I saw the before.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent">Note. As none of my National Songs /though<lb/> praised, and that highly, by almost every person that has read<lb/> them/ have yet been esteemed worthy of a tune by M<hi rend="ss">r</hi>. Nathan<lb/> or any of his fraternity, I will append by way of Note to<lb/> the foregoing two, a few free remarks upon the folly of<lb/> associating good music with trashy poetry. They originally<lb/> formed part of a critique I wrote for the "Weekly Register":<lb/> but the Editor, M<hi rend="ss">r</hi>. Duncan, while he admitted their general<lb/> justice, was yet afraid to insert them.</p>

<q>"There is no enquiry more vexatiously constant<lb/> amongst persons of real refinement, than the following:<lb/> How does it happen that the best modern airs are invariably<lb/> allied to the very worst songs that issue from the Press&#x2014;<lb/>the very Calabaus, as it were, of the poetical creation? Now<lb/> is this the result of wrong motives in the composers of these<lb/> airs, or of sheer stupidity? Many believe of wrong motives<lb/>&#x2014;the brood of an ungenerous fear, that in the event of their<lb/> being associated with equal poetry, the admiration of the<lb/> public would be thereby too much divided: that is to say,<lb/> the mere music would not then, in its appeal thereto,<pb n="108" facs="C376/00000058.jpg"/> stand so soveriegnly "alone in its glory"&#x2014;it would not imply of<lb/> itself so prettily "How perfect I were but for these verbal bonds".<lb/> But if the composers are actuated by such unworthily egotistical<lb/> motives, in the production of their half of the offence in question,<lb/> how blindly do they injure both themselves and their beautiful<lb/> art! In yielding to them, they commit a species of<lb/> artistical suicide; for let the most beef-witted and<lb/> obtuce amongst them but look the matter searchingly<lb/> in the face, and they <emph rend="ul">must</emph> perceive, if not wholly recreant<lb/> to common sense, that by thus endeavouring to force<lb/> their bantlings above <emph rend="ul">par</emph>, they <del>[unclear]</del> stumble upon the<lb/> precise means and method whereby to render them eventually<lb/> uncurrent&#x2014;to prepare for them, in fact, an almost certain<lb/> oblivion with the trash to which they are so injudiciously<lb/> wedded: seeing that a musical air has only a true<lb/> vitality as the expressed soul of some genuine Lyric&#x2014;<lb/> as the meet spouse of immortal verse. For though it<lb/> be true, that the Lyrical Paradise were Eveless without<lb/> Melody, it is just as true, that Melody itself can only<lb/> become the mother of definite and permanent delight, when<lb/> in fruition with the surer sentiment of language, as this<lb/> is moulded into the shapes of life and beauty by the magical<lb/> hand of Genius. As it is, however, our composers,<lb/> without the lucky mistake of an exception, continue to<lb/> launch their productions upon the unrefluent waters of<lb/> time, each with a verbal millstone hung to its unhappy<lb/> neck, and expect notwithstanding, that the world will<lb/> find them "after many days"&#x2014;and of course are disappointed.<lb/> But do these remarks dig into the veritable root of the<lb/> offence in question? Or are we to conclude rather, that even<lb/> our best composers make their music as monkey's do<lb/> grimaces, without being prompted thereto, or aided therein,<pb n="109" facs="376/00000058.jpg"/> by any purely mental suggestions whatever? This no doubt<lb/> is <subst><del>[unclear]</del> <add>rather merciless</add></subst> work; <subst><del n="1">and</del> <del n="2">[unclear]</del> <add>inasmuch as it</add></subst> places the musical fraternity <del>some-<lb/>-what mercilessly</del> within <subst><del>the</del> <add>point blanck</add></subst> range of a double battery.<lb/> Still they merit the position; and must be even content to<lb/> remain obnoxious to its severity, until such time as<lb/> their blundering profanation of the most sacred things<lb/> of the imagination, shall be atoningly corrected."</q>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> &#x019F; [ADDITION HERE: SEE BELOW] <del>Let it be asked again and again, What<lb/> has human good to do with the sword</del>? Violence<lb/> can but beget violence, as the tiger can only procreate<lb/> its kind. The only subjects <del>[unclear]</del> proper for dispute<lb/> under God's heaven are the eternal distinctions<lb/> between Right and Wrong, Truth and Falshood&#x2014;<lb/> and for the purpose alone of their perfect<lb/> elucidation: and what can the sword prove with<lb/> regard to these? Let that blood-stained sneerer,<lb/> Frederic of Prussia, falsely called <emph rend="ul">great</emph>&#x2014;let even<pb n="131" facs="C376/00000069.jpg"/> him answer. "Providence (said he) has always a<lb/> special leaning to the strongest battalion."</p>

<q rend="indent">"War of defence (says Bucke) is alone justifiable.<lb/> The rest is infamy: and the man who urges it, proclaims<lb/> it, or assists in it, be he prince, minister, or counsellor,<lb/> is entitled to the united hisses of an injured world."</q>

<p rend="indent">As to Napoleon's incarceration at St. Helena <add>which has been mouthed about so fulsomely,</add>, let<lb/> us listen to the powerfully fraternal sentiments of a<lb/> true soldier of God (and therefore of Humanity) who<lb/> "home hath gone and ta'en his wages." I mean the late<lb/> D<hi rend="ss">r</hi>. Channing.</p>

<q rend="indent">"When (said he) we strive to fix our thoughts upon<lb/> the sufferings of the injured hero, other and more<lb/> terrible sufferings, of which he was the cause, rush<lb/> upon us; and his complaints, however loud and<lb/> angry, are drowned in groans and execrations<lb/> which fill our ears from every region he traversed.<pb n="132" facs="C376/00000070.jpg"/> We have no tears to spare for fallen greatness, when<lb/> that greatness was founded in crime, and reared<lb/> by force and perfidy. We reserve them for <del>[unclear]</del><lb/> those on whose ruin it rose. We keep our sympathies<lb/> for our race, for human nature in its humbler<lb/> forms, for the impoverished peasant, the widowed<lb/> mother, the violated virgin; and are even perverse<lb/> enough to rejoice, that the ocean has a prison house<lb/> where the author of those miseries may be safely<lb/> lodged."</q>

<p rend="indent">Away then with the world's insane admiration<lb/> of mere warriors and conquerors&#x2014;"mighty murderers"<lb/> at the best! At the close of their horrible careers,<lb/> may they forever henceforth sit alone in desolation;&#x2014;<lb/> alone, like Marius, a ruin amid the ruins of<lb/> Carthage;&#x2014;alone, like Napolion, fastened to the<lb/> ocean-rock of St. Helena!</p>

<p rend="indent">But War is a "beautiful game", saith the luminary<lb/> of the 'Australian' newspaper, in his heroical notice<lb/> of a red-coated review in the Domain the other<lb/> day.

<p rend="indent">I will extend this Note with a prose<lb/> piece which was <del>originally published in a Colonial<lb/> newspaper, since defunct, as a military reminiscence,<lb/> and which was</del> suggested by an idea I had on the<lb/> subject of War: namely, that a highly benevolent<pb n="134" facs="C376/00000071.jpg"/> man could not slay a fellow creature even in battle,<lb/> without being occasionally troubled afterwards with the<lb/> memory of his deed&#x2014;especially whenever his remembrance<lb/> of it might be strongly excited by real or fancied<lb/> resemblances between the Living and the Dead. And<lb/> to embody this idea as strikingly as possible&#x2014;to<lb/> stamp it with as much Crusoe-like verisimilitude<lb/> as I could, I gave to it the medium of a<lb/> direct personal anecdote.</p>

<p rend="indent">Major H., of the &#x2014;&#x2014; Dragoons, had the tallest<lb/> forehead I have ever seen, with Benevolence coning up<lb/> at the top of it, like the larger end of an egg; and<lb/> the following ancedote is strikingly confirmative of the<lb/> predications of Phrenology as to the probable manifestations<lb/> of so excessive a developement of that organ. At<lb/> the time of which I write,&#x2014;certainly,&#x2014;the poor Major<lb/> was in a state of bodily and mental morbidity, he having<lb/> just partially recovered from a
severe fit of sickness;&#x2014;<pb n="135" facs="C376/00000071.jpg"/> still the predominant action of the faculty was in<lb/> conclusive accordance with the Phrenological theory.<lb/> He was taking a quiet evening stroll with myself upon<lb/> the parade, and feeling at length that he had rather<lb/> overtasked his strength, was about leaving me, to return to<lb/> his quarters, when a young trooper of another Regiment<lb/> came towards us from the Brigade Office, having a<lb/> message for myself. As he approached and saluted<lb/> us, it struck me that the motions and manner of the Major<lb/> were unaccountably singular. Advancing rapidly two<lb/> or three paces, he stared earnestly and even wildly at the<lb/> face and form of the trooper, and then turning away<lb/> with a suppressed yet perfectly audible groan, abruptly<lb/> bad me good evening, and departed for his quarters;<lb/> ere I could make any enquiry as to the cause of his<lb/> apparent pain and distress, though much and anxiously<lb/> concerned on his account. But to be brief: so soon<lb/> as I had dispatched the Regimental business of which<pb n="136" facs="C376/00000072.jpg"/> the young trooper had been sent to remind me, I hurried<lb/> to my friend, the Major's, to enquire after his condition.<lb/> I found him lying at full length upon a sofa, with<lb/> a settled and almost <del>[?]despairing</del> despairing
expression<lb/> of pain and sorrow dispread, like a cloud, over his<lb/> naturally amiable and paternal countenance. He nodded<lb/> to me as I entered, and held out his hand in silence;<lb/> taking which, I enquired with infinite solicitude,&#x2014;for<lb/> I loved the man,&#x2014;whether there was any serious occasion<lb/> for apprehending a relapse of his complaint?&#x2014;what<lb/> was the nature of the attack which had affected him<lb/> so suddenly, an hour previously, on the Parade?&#x2014;<lb/> and so forth. "No&#x2014;no", said he, "that was not it.<lb/> I will tell you the cause." Having thus expressd himself,<lb/> he <add>again</add> became <del>again</del> silent for nearly a minute, during<lb/> which he had that peculiar fixedness of eye which the<lb/> world-wearied invalid is so wont to have when<lb/> painfully
thinking back through a long lapse of time;<lb/> then turning on his side, he looked up somewhat studiously<pb n="137" facs="C376/00000072.jpg"/> into my face, and proceeded in his confidential intention,<lb/> as I then thought, rather incoherently. "War is a bad<lb/> trade", said he, shaking his tall grey head in the<lb/> dusky twilight that fell through the window<lb/> immediately above the sofa, and while he did so,<lb/> the solemn purpose of his thoughts deepened the<lb/> centre of his pale high forehead into palpable<lb/> shadow,&#x2014;"It is a bad trade at the best. Were<lb/> I the father of twenty sons, not one of them, if by<lb/> any means I could prevent it, should ever traffic<lb/> in war." I was about to reply, by some general<lb/> remark in defence of legitimate warfare, when he suddenly<lb/> sat up, and continued: "The young trooper I saw<lb/> this evening upon the Parade, was a living counterpart <add>both in face and figure</add><lb/> of a young Frenchman whom, twenty years ago, I sabred<lb/> at Salamanca, and the mere sight of him made me<lb/> feel again&#x2014;yes, <emph rend="ul">again</emph>, like a murderer&#x2014;like another<lb/> Cain!" "Well but," said I, "I am sure Major, from all<pb n="138" facs="C376/00000073.jpg"/> I know <add>or could believe</add> of your nature and habits, that you slew<lb/> the Frenchman fairly." "Oh yes, I slew him fairly<lb/> enough, according to the sanctions of the War", replied<lb/> the invalid, with a dreary touch of irony in the<lb/> tone of his voice; "that is, I did not deal him an<lb/> unnessary [sic] blow&#x2014;not a blow I mean that could<lb/> be spared from the defence of my own life: and<lb/> <emph rend="ul">yet</emph> (the emphasis of the <emph rend="ul">yet</emph>, as he expressed it, cannot<lb/> be written)&#x2014;and yet, when he fell headlong from<lb/> his horse, and lay dying and dead upon the ground<lb/> beneath me, I felt, I tell you, like a murderer:<lb/> I felt that I had drunk, and that deeply, of the<lb/> blood-reaming cup of Cain! I was the
only sur=<lb/>-viving son <del>of my</del> of my mother, and it struck me,<lb/> <del>[?]resembling</del> that I once had a brother resembling the<lb/> youth I had slain. There was a cry of blood coming<lb/> up against me! And had I been at that moment the<lb/> possessor of <subst><del>an</del> <add>a</add></subst> universe, I could have given it as freely<lb/> as ever I gave a penny to a beggar, to have been able<pb n="139" facs="C376/00000073.jpg"/> to have said effectually to that slaughtered son of<lb/> man, Arise! and be as you were but now, before<lb/> this our bloody meeting in the horrible traffic of war!<lb/> And yesterday <emph rend="ul">again</emph>,&#x2014;twenty years after,
at the<lb/> mere sight of a youth who resembled him, I felt<lb/> <emph rend="ul">again</emph>, I say, like a murderer&#x2014;like another Cain!"</p>

<p rend="indent">And now, to bring the whole subject round<lb/> to a healthy and final moral, I will annex a<lb/>Sonnet on<lb/> True and False Glory. [...]</p>

<l><subst><del>A sad affair 'tis</del> <add>Fancy the thing</add></subst>! <subst><del>Fancy</del> <add>Then mark you</add></subst> Settler Will</l>
<l>Severely <subst><del>studying</del> <add>conning</add></subst> yon peculiar hill;</l>
<l><subst><del>From which he learns</del> <add>To learn at length</add></subst> this lesson of dismay,</l>
<l>Told bluntly&#x2014;"William, thou hast gone astray!"</l>
<l>At this he backward <del>turns</del> hastes, intent to find</l>
<l>Some prospect more familiar to his mind.</l>
<l>How puzzling tis! still stranger seems to grow</l>
<l>The backward scene o'er which he hurries so:</l>
<l>Whereat Will mutters, as he scans the ground,</l>
<l>"Dang it! the world is surely twisted round!"</l>
<l>Then, with a sudden jerk, the anxious swain</l>
<l>Turns, just to contemplate that hill again.</l>
<l><add>Which was the first to warn him, as he thought,</add></l>
<l><add>That his bush-instinct had been napping caught,</add></l>
<l><subst><del>Gad</del> <add>But</add></subst>! which is which? A dozen summits lie</l>
<l>As like as eggs against the twilight sky,</l>
<l>And it amongst them. With a tart surprise,</l>
<l>Will opes his mouth at this, and eke his eyes!</l>
<l>Squats on his hams, and strains his neck, thus bent,</l>
<l>And this way bobs his head, and that,&#x2014;intent</l>
<l>To put the pleasant fact to final test:&#x2014;</l>
<l>Which done, he draws a long breath, muttering,&#x2014;"Well,<lb/> I'm blest!"</l></lg>

<pb n="153" facs="C376/00000080.jpg"/>

<lg><l rend="indent">In short he's lost: and seeing that the night</l>
<l>Will be a wild one, he (as well he might)</l>
<l>Scratches his head, and much that member loads</l>
<l>With execrations: "What! forsake the roads</l>
<l>For shorter cuts, so near the day's decline,</l>
<l>'Mongst hills and brushes?&#x2014;Drat this head o' mine!</l>
<l>The night is settling round as thick as mire;</l>
<l>The Bush too's roaring like a world on fire!</l>
<l>I am not one much given to foolish frights,</l>
<l>And far too knowing to believe in sprites;</l>
<l>But such a night in such a curs&#x00EB;d place</l>
<l>Might well nigh put one in a raving case:</l>
<l>And somewhere here, for certain it is said,</l>
<l>The Blacks have burial&#x2014;Oh! this silly head!</l>
<l>Besides, Peg may forget to bed the sow,</l>
<l>Big Bess, that is so near her pigging now;</l>
<l>Nor can she by herself, with all her care</l>
<l>Secure the stack from that <emph rend="ul">downdacious</emph> mare;</l>
<l>Or pen those <emph rend="ul">gallows</emph> calves up from the kine&#x2014;</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">Thus bringing into catalogue his woes,</l>
<l>On, dogg'd and desperate, he at random goes.</l>

<l>Vainly thy Peg now watches for her Will,</l>

<pb n="154" facs="C376/00000081.jpg"/>

<l>To loom in sight upon the 'customed hill,</l>
<l>Thus saying to herself, with gesture grim,</l>

<l>And just as vainly dost thou onward toil,</l>
<l>Dismally <hi rend="ul">cooeying</hi> all the weary <del>wile</del> while,</l>

<l>Most woe-begone, unlucky son of Eve!</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Worn out at <subst><del>length</del> <add>last</add></subst>, he throws him down,&#x2014;and sleep</l>
<l>There finds him, coiled beside a bleaching heap</l>
<l>Of drifted leaves, that patteringly alight</l>
<l>From the hoarse blast&#x2014;while loaden with its might,</l>
<l>Huge trees sway solemnly o'er the unconscious wight.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But now, when Night, a limping hag, her shades</l>

<l><add>Begins the onslaught, horrible his fright</add></l>
<l><add>Great his despair,yet he maintains the fight!</add></l>
<l>But just as in the strife a leg is lost,</l>
<l>/That luckless leg most bitten by the frost/</l>
<l>Sweating and wild, he wakes. His face forlorn</l>
<l>First rubbed, he looks, and hails the wished-for Morn:</l>
<l>Then scans the unknown scene with rueful eyes,</l>
<l>And folds his arms, and shakes his head, and sighs:</l>

<pb n="156" facs="C376/00000082.jpg"/>

<l>When hark! distinctly although far away,</l>
<l>He hears some watch-dog's thrice repeated bay&#x2014;</l>
<l>Starts from his huddled posture at a bound,</l>
<l>And joyfully pushes for the grateful sound.</l>
<l>Nor long his search: for now the Morning Star</l>
<l>Wheels from the eastern steep her shining car,</l>
<l>And in her pallid but effectual glow</l>
<l>A Hut and Clearing stand revealed below.</l>
<l>Thither he hastens&#x2014;and is welcomed there,</l>
<l>Consoled and fed with hospitable care;</l>
<l>And when the sun shall crown the wintry day,</l>
<l>His kindly Host shall set him on his homeward<lb/> way.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. <subst><del>This</del> <add>The rough draft of this</add></subst> Poem was originally published in<lb/> the <ref target="H230a">Australasian Chronicle</ref>, when that paper was<lb/> edited by M<hi rend="ss">r</hi>.

At that moment,<lb/> however, a number of curlews began to muster<lb/> in the dim glades about us, and send forth<lb/> their <del>wild</del> "ominous" cries with a wild and<lb/> startling effect; and in reply to his remark,<lb/> I exclaimed: "But hark! I omitted to notice<lb/> those <add>strangely</add> discordant gentlemen:&#x2014;the Poem is <del>[unclear]</del> so<lb/> far incomplete." The lines descriptive of their<lb/> peculiar nocturnal orgies were immediately<lb/> upon the "Muse's anvil", and had, ere we had<lb/> reached home, the approval of my companion,<lb/> as a finishing stroke to the Performance.<lb/> I have noticed this circumstance, thus at length,<lb/> to shew <add>inferentially,</add> the critical <add>study</add> I have ever bestowed upon all<lb/> <add>and every of</add> my poetical pictures of Bush matters.</p></div>

<lg><l rend="indent">Still as a Poet he is great and rare!</l>
<l>A King of Thought, upon the peak of bare</l>
<l>And rigid majesty, for power immense</l>
<l>Enthroned forever! And in spirit thence&#x2014;</l>
<l>/Rid of the beggary of his Goody Blakes,</l>
<l>And such mere bugbears of the mystic "Lakes"!/</l>
<l>Thence let him waft us on a white-wing'd dream</l>
<l>Within the murmur of some profluent stream;</l>
<l>And there,&#x2014;just whither a dim line of brakes</l>
<l>In the remotest haze of distance shakes,</l>
<l><del>Let Peter Bell</del> <subst><del>o</del><add>O</add></subst>n his love rounds <add>let Peter Bell</add> be seen;&#x2014;</l>
<l>Seen o'er the White Doe, on the herbage green</l>
<l>Heard breathing where she lies; and near her there,</l>
<l>"The oldest <emph rend="ul">seeming</emph> Man that ever wore grey hair".</l>
<l>Then shall we find him verily a Seer</l>
<l>In Nature's mysteries, simple and severe.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">With what a plenitude of pure delight</l>
<l>He triumphs on the mountain's <subst><del>misty</del> <add>cloudy</add></subst> height!</l>
<l>With what a gleeful harmony of joy</l>

<pb n="162" facs="C376/00000085.jpg"/>

<l>He wanders down the vale, "as happy as a Boy!"</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Then in his verse, each picture-pregnant phrase</l>
<l>Full to the eye some given shape convey<del>e</del>s;</l>
<l>And thus, though in the jarring City pent,</l>
<l>Through him we reach the Country and content:</l>
<l>Fond Memory apprehends, with gladdened eyes,</l>
<l>All that is <subst><del>rich in every</del> <add>richest in each</add></subst> wilding's dyes,</l>
<l>As blending with the beauty and the grace</l>
<l>Of some bright advent of our happier days;&#x2014;</l>
<l>Hears through the sway of greenest boughs, as heard</l>
<l>Even then, the far voice of some favorite bird;&#x2014;</l>
<l>The murmurous industry of bees;&#x2014;the low</l>
<l>Responsive throbs of Echo,&#x2014;throbbing slow</l>
<l>Out of some lonely dell, as to the tread</l>
<l>Of our own feet in days forever fled!</l>
<l>Then of some brook that gushes in his lines</l>
<l>Glad Fancy drinks, or on the bank reclines;</l>
<l>While of far cloud, grey rock, and ancient tree,</l>
<l>The dusky shadows on the page we see;</l>
<l>Yea, the air sweetens as the spells <subst><del>[unclear]</del> <add>prevail,</add></subst></l>
<l>And our locks seem to wave as in a<lb/> mountain gale!</l></lg>

<pb n="163" facs="C376/00000085.jpg"/>

<lg><l rend="indent">Still there remains to tell the charm serene</l>
<l>Wherewith this Bard most sanctifies the Scene:</l>
<l>'Tis that, with eyes of love, he's quick to find</l>
<l>In all its forms meet ministers to Mind;</l>
<l>And that with the rare wealth of his own heart,</l>
<l>As with a golden chain, he interlinks each part.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">But vainly the fond <subst><del>heart</del> <add>spirit</add></subst> of Youth may look</l>
<l>For its peculiar food in Wordsworth's Book;</l>
<l>Where Passion is but introduced<subst><del>,</del><add>:</add></subst> to wear</l>
<l>A vestal's tenderness, demure as fair.</l>
<l>Not as to see it the new soul desires,</l>
<l>In all the splendor of its tragic fires!</l>
<l>Or, at the least, in all the bright distress</l>
<l>And rosy beauty of its wilfulness.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>(Note. When these Critical Rhymes were written,<lb/> I had not read the Excursion, and therefore it is<lb/> that no allusion is made to it. I have since perused<lb/> that great Poem with infinite admiration and<lb/> delight; but to the further confirmation of the opinions<lb/> expressed, or attempted to be expressed, in the opening<lb/> passage of the Text. In proof of Wordsworth's want<lb/> of breadth in his moral perceptions, need I make further<lb/> reference than to his Thanksgiving Ode? in which<lb/> production there are lines, if not whole passages, that are<pb n="164" facs="C376/00000086.jpg"/> only worthy of being inscribed upon a gibbet.)</p>

<p rend="indent">The popular charge against the Poetry<lb/> of Wordsworth is its <emph rend="ul">bareness</emph>: and indeed it is<lb/> often open to such an accusation. We should look<lb/> twice, however,&#x2014;and the second time with a more<lb/> critical heed, at any Poem of his which we may<lb/> be about to pronounce chargeable with this defect;<lb/> for there is a profound simplicity which the hasty reader<lb/> is very liable to mistake for it; and which <emph rend="ul">may</emph> be,<lb/> and <subst><del>often</del> <add>generally</add></subst>
<emph rend="ul">is</emph>, as beautiful as it is profound. And<lb/> of this character, in the main, is the simplicity,&#x2014;<lb/> that is, the <emph rend="ul">apparent bareness</emph> of Wordsworth.</p>

<p rend="indent">Besides, those who charge his Productions with<lb/> plainness, over-simplicity, want of external brilliancy,<lb/> and so forth, forget that there are several kinds or<lb/> species of Poetry; and that our individual preferences<lb/> for any one or more of these several kinds, are not so<lb/> much questions of <del>Poetry</del> poetical excellence, as of<lb/> personal taste. Some readers delight most in<lb/> those Poems in which Fancy predominates; others in<lb/> those to which Imagination gives the prevailing tone;<lb/> others again, in
those which chiefly appeal to the<lb/> reason&#x2014;or in didactic pieces. For myself,<lb/> I prefer those poetical effusions in which Intellect<lb/> <emph rend="ul">and</emph> Imagination prevail equally, to the general<lb/> exclusion of mere fancifulness&#x2014;mere Moore=like<pb n="165" facs="C376/00000086.jpg"/> brilliancy. And of this character, in the main,<lb/> are the Poems of Wordsworth.</p>

<p rend="indent">There is one marked excellence in the writings<lb/> of this Author that I have never <add>seen</add> sufficiently insisted<lb/> upon even by his most ardent admirers. I mean<lb/> a certain pregnancy and completeness of verbal<lb/> expression; in which respect he seems to me to have<lb/> no equal amongst our Poets of the present century,&#x2014;<lb/>and not to have been surpassed by any of<lb/> all time that I am acquainted with;&#x2014;and<lb/> hence it is that his lines are so strikingly<lb/> quotable. I would append instances of<lb/> this <add>kind of</add> excellence, if the multitude of such, which are<lb/> every where to be met with in his writings, did<lb/> not advertise me, that the difficulty of selection<lb/> would be likely to involve the consumption of more<lb/> time than I can just now afford.</p></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. [BEGIN NOT CORRECTED]I sometimes think myself fortunate in the worldly<lb/> experience of the last five years of my life; but at other times,<lb/> I can scarcely forbear accusing Providence of something akin to<lb/> malignity in inflicting it upon me: for it has all but ruined<lb/> my faith in human nature; giving to its whole moral aspect<lb/> the furtive and cowardly experience of a lie. Pretence - mean,<lb/> miserably <add>mouthy</add> pretence, would indeed seem its universal mainstay <lb/>and only anchor of <del>rely</del> reliance, whether at sea or in port, at <lb/>home or abroad! And is there no redemption for it? The <lb/>cold preachments of mere Church-systems, - the stale ethics and <lb/>frouthy legalities of mere class schools and colleges, - the meagre <lb/>moralities of mere conventions,   social and political; - these cannot <lb/>redeem it: they have been tried, and approve themselves, each and <lb/>all, but a part of its pretensiveness.</p>

<p>Well; and what then remains to be done? Must we <lb/>even heave <del>it</del> <add>our humanity</add> overboard, as a radical deformity, a thing <del><unclear/></del><lb/> incorrigible? Let us first try another remedy.</p>

<p>The brave unpattering habitude of perfect, <hi rend="ul">educated</hi> <lb/>social equality, of absolute, <hi rend="ul">instructed</hi>,   soul-ennobling individual <lb/>liberty, - that is to say, entire freedom from all false, fashionable, <lb/>and juggling necessities, would assuredly work out for it, <lb/>in <del n="1">all</del> <add>every</add> truthful regard<del n="2">s</del>, a more effectual and abiding <lb/>redemption: and let us first try <hi rend="ul">that</hi>. To shackle it <lb/>down as hitherto, is but to cramp and <del><unclear>straight</unclear></del> <lb/>straiten it into falshood. To liberate it thoroughly, were <lb/>to give it, at all events, its best remaining and most <lb/>honest chance of escape into Truth.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="C376/00000088.jpg"/>

<p>But would an <del>individual Freedom</del> <add>individual enfranchisement</add>, thus extensive, tend <lb/>in anywise to relax our sense of social obligations, - such as grow <lb/>naturally out of our humanity, and are sanctions both by reason and <lb/>affection? In nowise would it do so. But it would infinitely exalt <lb/>our moral willinghood. The <del>right <unclear/></del> righteous discharge of <lb/>all our true duties would more than ever the conscious glory <lb/>of our manhood: because, by being separated from all false and <lb/>mistifying requirements, their essential sacredness would be but the <lb/>more clearly discernible. They would then act upon us with the <lb/>directness and <add>healthy</add> energy which are the inevitable attributes of <lb/>Truth, when it is divested of all "baser matter." But no obediential <lb/>neccessities, <del><unclear>exposed</unclear></del> <add>imposed</add> by the selfishness of mere authority, could any <lb/>longer be juggled into the place and dignity of <hi rend="ul">duties</hi>. And here lies <lb/>the prime difference between the moral world as it is, and as it <lb/>should and might be - and I may add, as it <hi rend="ul">yet will be.</hi><lb/> Turn over to X <ref target="C376-00000088">*</ref></p>

<pb n="171" facs="C376/00000089.jpg"/>

<p>All lies and shuffling pretences are the impositions <lb/>of a slavery of some kind; and the perfect truthfulness <lb/>of man to man, can be born only of perfect liberty - of a <lb/>perfect and conscious freedom of man from man: in fine, <lb/>such a measure of liberty, in all directions, to the <lb/>individual, as shall be bounded only by the co-extensive <lb/>liberties of all other individuals.</p>

<p>The Text was written on my reading certain <lb/>articles in Blackwood's Magazines, in which the writer labors <lb/>to deduce whatever incapacity Man has hitherto evinced for a state <lb/>of democracy, from the doctrine of Original Sin. To this, <lb/>it will be seen, I so far assent as to admit that to some <lb/>great depravation of his moral nature <add>(supposing him to have been originally perfect)</add> is owing the fact of <lb/>his having fallen away from <add>the capacity <del>for</del> of</add> such a state; but I hold <lb/>at the same time, that the democratic principle is that alone <lb/>which can eventually restore him to such a measure of social <lb/>perfection as may be proper <add>and possible</add> to the present stage of his <lb/>spiritual <del>progress</del> <add>abidence</add>. It is the Alpha and Omega - <lb/>the first and the last <del>stage</del> <add>condition</add> of human community: <lb/>the lost birthright of    Equality, upon the regainment <lb/>of which depends the moral, social, and political salvation <lb/>of the world. For man must be denied all    <lb/> adventitions rank and power on the one hand, and <lb/>educated out of all servile respect <del>such obedience</del> <add>for</add><lb/> <del>to</del> them on the other, before his heart and mind can <lb/>breathe and act freely, and with <add>a</add> perfect social<lb/> <del>and political</del> integrity.[END NOT CORRECTED</p></div>

<head type="subtitle">/Imitated from the German./</head>

<lg><l n="1">One sultry morn, out of the sea wave wild</l>
<l>A speck-like Cloud arose, and, <subst><del>like</del> <add>as</add></subst> a child,</l>
<l>Playfully glided up the broad blue sky,</l>
<l>And o'er the sun-parched hills all brown and dry.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">Onward she glided, through the azure air</l>
<l>Borne by the breeze without or toil or care,</l>
<l>Till looking down in her ethereal joy,</l>
<l>She marked Earth's laborers at their hard employ.</l>
<l>"And oh!" she said, "that I could something do</l>
<l>To ease the burthens of yon toilsome crew,</l>
<l>To give the hungry food, the thirsty drink&#x2014;</l>
<l>The thought of good is very sweet to think!"</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The day advanced&#x2014;and the Cloud greater grew,</l>
<l>And greater still; and her desire to shew</l>
<l>Some kindness unto mankind, greatened too.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The heat waxed fiercer, until all the land</l>
<l>Burned in the sun's rays like a mighty brand.</l>
<l>Ill could Earth's laborers their toil endure,</l>
<l>Though still they toiled&#x2014;for they were very poor.</l>
<l>And many a look, from time to time, they sped</l>
<l>Tow'rds that fair Cloud;&#x2014;beseeching looks, that said:</l>

<l>And tow'rds the Earth her bounteous being bowed.</l>
<l>But then recalling a tradition she</l>
<l>Had, <subst><del>when</del> <add>while</add></subst> a child, learned from her native sea;</l>
<l>That when a cloud adventures from the skies</l>
<l>To near the altars of the hills&#x2014;she dies!</l>
<l>Awhile she wavered, and was blown about,</l>
<l>Hither and thither, by the winds of doubt.</l>
<l>But in the midst of heaven at length all still</l>
<l>She stood, and said within herself, "I <emph rend="ul">will</emph>!"</l>
<l>"Yea, in the glad strength of devotion, I</l>
<l><emph rend="ul">Will</emph> help you, though in helping you,&#x2014;I die!"</l></lg>

<l>O'er the parched fields, in her angelic love,</l>
<l>She spread her wings <subst><del>even</del> <add>out</add></subst> like a brooding dove:</l>
<l>Till, as her purpose deepened into storm,</l>
<l>So awfully majestic grew her form,</l>

<l>"Receive me&#x2014;<subst><del>I will</del> <add>So I</add></subst> die for you&#x2014;in rain!"</l>
<l>Suddenly flashed then through her full-grown form</l>
<l>The glory of her <emph rend="ul">will</emph>&#x2014;the firstling of the storm!</l>
<l>The thunder followed, a terrific sound</l>
<l>Loud-doubling and reverberating round.</l>

<lg><l rend="indent">Fa[r] as the rain extended o'er the land,</l>
<l>A splendid bow the freshened prospect spanned,</l>
<l>As the last greeting of that pure and dove-</l>
<l>Like spirit of self-sacrificing love.</l>
<l>The Rainbow vanished, but the blessing craved,</l>
<l>Long rested on the land the Cloud had saved.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. I will append a prose version of the<lb/> above, as translated by Miss Margaret Taylor.</p>

<p><q>"One sultry summer's morning a little cloud rose<lb/> out of the sea, and glided like a playful child through<lb/> the blue sky and over the wide earth which lay beneath it,<pb n="175" facs="C376/00000091.jpg"/> gloomy and parched with the long drought. As the<lb/> cloudlet sailed along, she saw far beneath her the poor<lb/> laborers toiling in the sweat of their brow, whilst she<lb/> was wafted gently along by the soft morning breeze,<lb/> without either care or toil. "Ah," said she, "could I<lb/> but do something to lighten the labors of these poor men<lb/> upon the earth, drive away their cares, give food to the<lb/> hungry, and refreshment to the thirsty!"</q></p>

<p><q>The day advanced, and the cloud grew bigger<lb/> and bigger; and as she grew, her desire to devote her<lb/> life to mankind grew likewise stronger. But the heat<lb/> waxed more intense upon the earth; the sun's rays burned<lb/> like a very fire, till the wearied laborers nearly fainted<lb/> in the fields; and yet they worked on and on, for they<lb/> were very poor. From time to time they cast a piteous<lb/> look up at the cloud, as much as to say, "Ah, that you<lb/> would help us!"</q></p>

<p><q>"I <emph rend="ul">will</emph> help you," said the Cloud; and she began<lb/> to sink gently down. But presently she recalled what she<lb/> had once heard when a little child, in the depths of the sea,<lb/> that if a cloud ventures to near the earth, she dies. For<lb/> awhile she wavered, and was driven hither and thither by<lb/> her thoughts; but at length she stood still, and with all the<lb/> gladness of a good resolution she cried, "Ye weary men<lb/> who are toiling on the earth, I will help you."</q></p>

<p><q>Filled with this thought, the Cloud suddenly expan-<lb/>-ded to a gigantic size; she had never imagined herself<lb/> capable of such greatness. Like an angel of blessing<lb/> she stood above the earth, and spread her wings over the <pb n="176" facs="C376/00000092.jpg"/> parched fields, and her form became so glorious&#x2014;so<lb/> awful, that she filled man and beast with fear;<lb/> and the trees and grass bent before her, while yet they<lb/> knew that she was their benefactor.</q></p>

<p><q>"Ay, I will help you", said the cloud again:<lb/> "receive me&#x2014;I <del>will</del> die for you." A sudden will at<lb/> this moment darted through her whole form, a brilliant<lb/> flash gleamed across her, and the thunder reverberated<lb/> round. Strong was that <emph rend="ul">will</emph>, and stronger still the<lb/> love, <del>that</del> penetrated by which she fell, and dissolved<lb/> her in a shower that dropt blessings upon the earth.<lb/> The rain was her work&#x2014;the rain was also her death,<lb/> and the act was glorious. Far over the land, <add>as</add> wide<lb/> as the rain extended, a brilliant bow arose, formed<lb/> of the purest rays of heaven's height: it was the last<lb/> greeting of that pure and self-sacrificing spirit of<lb/> love. The rainbow vanished, but the blessing<lb/> of the cloud long rested on the land which she<lb/> had saved."</q></p></div>

No doubt, this is witty, and<lb/> may be characteristic&#x2014;but then, it is stolen; and what<lb/> is worse, it is half spoilt in what Ancient Pistol would<lb/> call the "conveyance." It is from the sayings of a<lb/> <subst><del>facetious American, who, in allusion to some specious<lb/> city[CHECK -] founding speculation of his day, was wont to com-<lb/> pare it to one of their (the American's) Great Western<lb/> Roads, which opened magnificently through a stately<lb/> avenue, but ended in a <emph rend="it">squirrel track</emph>, and ran up a tree</del> <add>of a facetious American, who was wont<lb/> to compare the party promises of his<lb/> Countrymen, to their Great Western Roads,<lb/> "which opened stately enough, with planted<lb/> trees on either side, but soon became<lb/> narrow and narrower,&#x2014;till they ended<lb/> in a <emph rend="ul">squirrel track</emph> and ran up a tree."</add></subst><lb/> Now in the apparently slight difference between what<lb/> "Cosmopolitan" says, and what the American said<lb/> before him, lies the very <emph rend="it">finish</emph> of the wit.

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><hi rend="sc">Note</hi>.&#x2014;No one but a fool or a designer, could set great<lb/> store by the current good opinion of the world. Considered<lb/> otherwise than as a conduit to something beyond itself, it is<lb/> morally valueless, for it is always more or less in error. If<lb/> the wise do not despise, they at least always distrust it. They<lb/> know how vain and hollow a thing it is: how worthlessly it is<lb/> often acquired, and how lightly lost. They know, moreover,<lb/> with what little merit it may be regained, however ignomi-<lb/>niously it had been before withdrawn, to be again lost,<lb/> perhaps, because of a great deal of merit. So hollow a thing<lb/> is the good opinion of the world: and it is capricious as it is<lb/> hollow. If it can find no other fault with Aristides, it will<lb/> revolt at his inevitable justice. Nay, it is an absolute fact,<lb/> that one man may enjoy it on account of something, which,<lb/> considered in its essence, or in its ultimate effect, is exactly<lb/> <emph rend="it">that thing</emph> which has cost it to another. Hence the man of great<lb/> designs, to fulfil them, must hold it cheap, or altogether forget<lb/> that it is babbling round about him. The good man, to<lb/> maintain his integrity. must habitually throw his conscience<lb/> into the scale against it; and if he do this, he too in the end<lb/> will hold it in no great esteem. The artist may <subst><del>form</del> <add>farm</add></subst> it if he<lb/> can: but in doing so, he must ever bear in mind the Fable of<lb/> the old man and his ass<gap/> If he endeavour to please all the<lb/> world, he will succeed in pleasing no part of it, and lose his<lb/> art into the bargain. The poet, if he regard it at all, it must<lb/> be only in the spirit of satire; for it is in his destiny to be<lb/> <subst><del>thought a fool or a madman for a long time by the world; and</del> <add>thought <del>[unclear]</del> either a fool or a madman<lb/> for a long time by the world, and</add></subst><lb/> even when it is led no longer to think of him thus dis-<lb/>paragingly, it will be just as far as ever from understanding<lb/> him aright. On the other hand, he who would always retain<lb/> it, and is able to do so, may have little vice, but he can have<lb/> no virtue. Neither can he have any distinctive <emph rend="it">character</emph>, good<lb/> or bad,&#x2014;a thing it can bear with only on the stage; for in<lb/> real life, all self strength is too apt to jostle and override it, to<lb/> be in any measure tolerable to the instinct of its own inherent<lb/> invalidity. This at least is the case, until <emph rend="it">character</emph> actually<lb/> does override it, and then, whether it be good or bad, it can<lb/> hold it at its mercy for a time, and it may be mould it to its<lb/> object<gap/> And why is all this so? It is so, because the world is<lb/> envious of all high individual merit, and loves to countenance<lb/> mediocrity; thus applying, both upwards and downwards, its<lb/> own universal standard. And farther, it is so, because our<lb/> moods of the moment, our social <hi rend="it">furors</hi>, and not our settled<lb/> beliefs and rational conclusions, are the usual upgetters of<lb/> that whirligig of opinion which is called the favor of the<lb/> world.</p></div>

<p rend="indent">No small share of the credit of arming public opinion<lb/> against the monstrous claims that were entertained by<lb/> the great Squatters some nine or ten years since, is due<lb/> even to <emph rend="it">me</emph>. Their claims, I say, as they were first<lb/> divulged at a memorable meeting in the Royal Hotel,<lb/> were then perfectly monstrous? comprehending nothing<lb/> less than the <hi rend="it">fee simples</hi> of their immense Runs.

Well, <emph rend="it">if not the first</emph>,<lb/> I was certainly amongst the first, to apprehend the<lb/> devilish evils that were clouding up in the probable<lb/> future from these monstrous claims; and at once waged<lb/> a merciless war against them, both in prose and<lb/> rhyme,&#x2014;till they toned down wonderfully. And this I<lb/> did, without one ray of encouragement, or one rag of<lb/> personal benefit, from any quarter whatever. Still I<lb/> did not slacken a whit in my opposition to them, both<lb/> in public and private, by articles in newspapers and<lb/> letters to
individuals, till I thought I could assure<lb/> myself of their ultimate frustration. But to the im-<lb/>mediate purpose of this note: perhaps the most<lb/> popularly telling things which I then threw forth<lb/> against them, were a series of "Squatter Songs," that<lb/> appeared from time to time in the <hi rend="it">Weekly Register</hi>, a<lb/> liberal journal long since defunct. The following is one<lb/> of these effusions, written in ridicule of the overweening<lb/> dislike which the greater would-be aristocratic squatters<lb/> were very forward in evincing towards their smaller<lb/> and more plebeanish <emph rend="it">brethren:</emph> and though somewhat<lb/> aside from the main matter, I republish it as a specimen.<lb/> In doing so, I shall be <subst><del>[unclear]</del> <add>re-fighting</add></subst>, as it were, a battle of<lb/> the past: but the pith of the thing, will, I think,<lb/> justify the indulgence.</p></div>

<head type="title">THE ADDER.</head>
<head type="subtitle"><hi rend="sc">a solemn "lyrical ballad."</hi></head>
<head type="sig"><hi rend="sc">By Charles Harpur</hi>.</head>

<lg><l n="1">An Adder there was in the hole of a tree</l>
<l>Where many and many a summer lodged he,</l>
<l>And often he'd bask in the sun for a spree,</l>
<l>Till he grew just as sleek as an Adder should be.</l></lg>

<lg><l>By that tree with the hole in't, a man full of care</l>
<l>Sat one day, as a weary man sits,&#x2014;anywhere;</l>
<l>When the Adder glode forth just to see what was there&#x2014;</l>
<l>And bit the poor man on the breech, I declare!</l></lg>

<lg><l>O Life it is weary and burthened with dole,</l>
<l>And danger revolves with our days as they roll!</l>
<l>And wherever a Tree has a rot in its hole,</l>
<l>There's a Snake on the look-out for just such a hole!</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><hi rend="sc">Note</hi>.&#x2014;The Moral of this poem is very profound and many-<lb/>phased. In the first place it is designed to impress upon us <add>the fact of</add> our<lb/> mundane insecurity at all times and in all places; and in the<lb/> next, to advise us that we should be very careful as to where we<lb/> deposit ourselves, whether upon a log in the bush, or in <subst><del>the</del> <add>a</add></subst> back-<lb/>slum taproom, or even in a City or Legislative Council; first<lb/> examining each place well, its dangers and requirements, together<lb/> with our own peculiar liabilities and natural or attained appro-<lb/>priateness. Hence this part of its moral should be commended&#x2014;<lb/> nay, it should commend itself to the particular study of all<lb/> incipient <subst><del>Doney Egans and Charles Kemps</del> <add>legislators</add></subst>, and a multitude<lb/> besides of would-be magistrates, and Botany Bay lords, and knights<lb/> of bunkum, with qualities better fitting them for bumbailiffs and<lb/> night soil scavengers.</p>

<p rend="indent">But the "deep thing" of the poem is shut up in the last stanza,<lb/> which is not only the sum of the other two, but intimates further,<lb/> that wherever there are haunts everyway adapted for the har-<lb/><subst><del>bouring of evil, the evil will be assuredly ready to avail itself of<lb/> them;</del> <add>-boring of any evil,&#x2014;there will that particular<lb/> evil assuredly be found,&#x2014;pat, as if by ap-<lb/>pointment,&#x2014;and ready to avail itself of their<lb/> covert;</add></subst> and that the best way to prevent and send it further a-field,<lb/> is to make short work with all its ascertained receptacles,&#x2014;namely,<lb/> <subst><del>wrong</del> <add>unelective</add></subst> Governments, Nominee Upper Houses, disreputable grog-<lb/>shops, and so forth;&#x2014;<hi rend="it">ad infinitum</hi>, I <del>was about to add, but I do<lb/> not like making a parade of my learning.</del> <del>I leave all that sort<lb/> of thing to less accredited penmen,&#x2014;to the briefless barristers of<lb/> the <hi rend="sc">Herald</hi>, and the John Bull-ites of the <hi rend="sc">Englishman</hi>.</del></p>

<p rend="indent"><del>No return to the matter of the poem. Observe, too, the pro-<lb/> found, or rather mysterious <emph rend="it">art</emph> of it&#x2014;the art of its kind and<lb/> class. It leaves us utterly in the dark as to how the man fared<lb/></del></p>

<p rend="indent"><add>Finally, observe the mysterious art of this<lb/> Poem&#x2014;the art (almost approaching to finesse)<lb/> of its kind and class. It leaves us utterly in<lb/> the dark as to how the man fared</add><lb/> from the bite of the Adder. Did he survive it, or did it kill him<lb/>&#x2014;who can tell? 'Most probably he died, and <emph rend="it">yet</emph> he <emph rend="it">might</emph> have<lb/>
got over it,' says the reader to himself, getting faster and faster on<lb/> the artistic hook of the poem, with every fresh wriggle of doubt<lb/> and twist of conjecture. And thus cunningly is he induced to<lb/> scratch the whole matter into his head<del>&#x2014;indelibly into it</del>, whatever<lb/> in so doing he may happen to scratch out of it.</p>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><hi rend="sc">Note</hi>.&#x2014;Methinks I hear some b<subst><del>a</del><add>u</add></subst>dge philosopher of<lb/> the old school, denouncing the above, as the "Forward<lb/> ho!" of a mere nineteenth century enthusiast: his own<lb/> profound <hi rend="it">dicta</hi> being, that men will never advance much<lb/> farther than they have already; and that if particular<lb/> communities do occasionally bound forward beyond a<lb/> certain limit (which he never defines), it is only to gra-<lb/>vitate back again into their old or a worse position.<lb/> Such <subst><del>auto</del> <add>anti</add></subst> progress notions, however, only show how<lb/> readily monarchists and aristocrats can believe in what<lb/> their natures and interests induce them to desire. But<lb/> I do not envy even the crowned head that can repose on<lb/> such a belief. Men so disposed can have little benevolent<lb/> feeling for their kind, and no sympathy with the higher<lb/> manifestations of moral and mental greatness. Neither<lb/> can they, if they think at all, have any merciful sense<lb/> of those traces of solemn agony with which Despotism<lb/> has entrenched the pale face of the Past. They can<lb/> have no fraternal apprehension of those accusing ghost-<lb/>voices which, to the ear of a rightly constituted mind,<lb/> are for ever surging upward against the spirit of wrong<lb/> dominion, from the untimely graves of forgotten<lb/> generations.</p>

<p rend="indent">But they are mistaken! God is just, though long-<lb/>suffering, and his mercy is over his works. The heaven-<lb/>beating agonies of millions of widows and orphans<lb/>&#x2014;made such by the wars and wrongs of oppression:&#x2014;<lb/>the gathered cries of numberless multitudes of men who<lb/> perished in the insanity of their king-worship: gathered<lb/> from the flight of ages, and accumulated as the sound<lb/> of many waters upon the present, must be heard at the<lb/> throne of the Almighty; and thence I believe, is derived<lb/> that wise daring by which the Franklins and Channings<lb/> and Lamartines of the race are impelled to evoke and<lb/> elucidate the principle of Perfect Liberty. For though<lb/> apparently of the growth of the Present these principles<lb/> are pressed into it from the Past. They are of the<lb/> present only as the present is the immortality of the<lb/> past.</p>

<p rend="indent">The writings of a Channing, wherever read, would<lb/> alone render impossible anything approaching to a moral<lb/> and mental stagnation for the future&#x2014;not to speak of<lb/> retrogression. Folly <subst><del>may</del> <add>might</add></subst> elsewhere fight (as in the<lb/> Crimea) for kings and emperors, and even for queens,&#x2014;<lb/> but not <subst><del><hi rend="it">[?]these</hi></del> <add>there</add></subst><hi rend="it">:</hi> for they are instinct with a power trans-<lb/>cending all the physical force in the world, and are of<lb/> more real value to it than all the war material it<lb/> contains, costly as that may be. "Heaven buries<lb/> madmen in the heaps they raise:" it says 'ruin to ruin,'<lb/> and desolation covers forever both wrong doer and<lb/> his deeds. But the works of the truly wise and righteous<lb/> come not thus to nought. They are baptised into<lb/> eternity<subst><del>. They</del><add>, &amp;</add></subst> become <subst><del>enwrought everlastingly</del> <add>everlastingly enwrought</add></subst> with<lb/> the constitution of the world.</p></div>

<l>For solace therefore I would dive with Truth</l>
<l rend="indent">Into the depths of her remotest lore:</l>
<l>Somewhere in Nature's mother-breast there's ruth</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet for her child, though wounded to the core&#x2014;</l>

<l>And Misery clothe her with the dreams of youth.</l></lg></div>

<head type="title">The Brook.</head>

<lg><l n="1">Home from a distant shore</l>
<l>The Wanderer was come:</l>
<l>He stood beside the Brook once more</l>
<l>That cooled his Childhood's home;</l>
<l>And while it warbled then</l>
<l>All adown its native glen,</l>
<l>Oh, why did I, he murmured,&#x2014;why <emph rend="ul">did</emph> I ever roam?</l></lg>

<lg><l>The life of other days</l>
<l>Thrills by me in its flow;</l>
<l>But then I miss the laughing gaze</l>
<l>And coming footstep low,</l>
<l>Of her, the blue-eyed Maid,</l>
<l>Who for fancy, as she said,</l>
<l>Used to meet me by its side&#x2014;such a long time ago.</l></lg>

<lg><l>How might I here forget</l>
<l>Those happy Summer days,</l>
<l>When in yon woodland nook we met</l>
<l>Beneath the bloomy sprays,</l>
<l>While thus unchanged by time,</l>
<l>It keeps ringing its moist chime,</l>
<l>Like some glad-hearted Truant who singeth as he strays?</l></lg>

<pb n="368" facs="C376/00000188.jpg"/>

<lg><l>Even yet within my mind</l>
<l>How warm the memory lies,</l>
<l>Of all the love so gayly kind&#x2014;</l>
<l>So giddy, yet so wise,</l>
<l>Which then, undreaming sin,</l>
<l>She kept storing for me in</l>
<l>The wild and piercing sweetness of her most merry eyes.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Alas! but they were flown,</l>
<l>Those happy days at last;</l>
<l>And I was wandering alone,</l>
<l>The sadder for the past;</l>
<l>With disenchanted eye,</l>
<l>Then to view both earth and sky</l>
<l>Through those unwholesome mists that load the world's wintry<lb/> blast.</l></lg>

<lg><l>As star by star is lost</l>
<l>In Ocean's clouding sky,</l>
<l>Ere half the gulf of Life be crost,</l>
<l><subst><del>As</del> <add>And</add></subst> trouble darkens by,</l>
<l>How all the golden things</l>
<l>To which Fancy lent her wings,</l>
<l>Out one by one are blotted from Hope's reverting eye!</l></lg>

<lg><l>And from more thoughtful years</l>
<l>What gain we in their stead?</l>

<pb n="369" facs="C376/00000188.jpg"/>

<l>That self-love which nor soothes nor cheers;</l>
<l>And /let the truth be said/</l>
<l>That knowledge whose stern part</l>
<l>Is to harden still the heart;</l>
<l>And that cramp wisdom last which so narroweth the head.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But what of Her who made</l>
<l>This woodland Brook so dear?</l>
<l>Here with <emph rend="ul">another</emph> hath she strayed,</l>
<l>His rural walk to cheer?</l>
<l>Or have her once glad eyes</l>
<l>Learned to weep 'neath other skies?</l>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note</hi>. <del>This Poem is a partial attempt to assimilate, in<lb/> effect, the pathos of moral and physical beauty, but<lb/> with the physical elements still subordinate to the<lb/> moral; on the principle, that the scenic excellence of<lb/> a Lyric<add>, however golden,</add> should never constitute more than <subst><del>the</del> <add>a</add></subst> setting,<lb/> as it were, for the gem of its subject, which should<lb/> be something human or having a human reference.</del></p>

<p rend="indent">It has been remarked by some one of the<lb/> difference between the poetical philosophy of Wordsworth<lb/> and that of Leigh Hunt, that the former would<lb/> render a <emph rend="ul">stake in a hedge</emph> an interesting object by<pb n="370" facs="C376/00000189.jpg"/> metaphysical attributions, aided accessorily by the<lb/> terse felicity of a Sculpturesque description of it, in<lb/> its merest identity; the latter by wreathing it with<lb/> a vine, or carving it into a distaff for some<lb/> rural Nymph of Classical beauty: the one depending<lb/> too exclusively <del>on</del> upon the pathos of the moral and<lb/> <add>the</add> primatively natural, in combination; the other<lb/> upon that of physical or artistic beauty in<lb/> perfection.<ref target="0">&#x203B;</ref> The conclusion, however, of the distinction<lb/> is faulty. Each is right in his peculiar direction.<lb/> Wordsworth is right in endeavouring to appreciate<lb/> as livingly as possible the coincidence which he<lb/> supposes to subsist between Spirit and Matter<lb/> in all the manifestations of Nature; esteeming matter,<lb/> however, as relatively subordinate, and as refining<lb/> into a still further and purer spiritual predominance.<lb/> Hunt, on the other hand, is also right, in being satisfied<lb/> with the sensuous and ornamental enjoyment of<lb/> the outward and physical expressions of her inward<lb/> and spiritual affinities. <subst><add>But t</add><del>T</del></subst>o blend the Poetics of<lb/> both <del>then</del>, were to be further, if not altogether right.<lb/> <del>Not that I mean to insinuate that the Poem thus annotated<lb/> is an example of this being accomplished: it being indeed,<lb/> nothing beyond apassing attempt to attain such</del><pb n="371" facs="C376/00000189.jpg"/> an end, in so far as it limits and subject<lb/>admitted.</p></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><ref>&#x203b;</ref> This, I think, is pretty nearly the substance of the<lb/> remark I allude to. In what author or work it was that<lb/> I met with it, I cannot now remember.</p></div>

<div type="MJSnote"><p>The first two stanzas have been lined through. A revised version of the deleted first paragraph of the Note is on p. 374:</p>

<p>The truest kind of poetry is that which<lb/> assimilates the pathos of moral and<lb/> physical beauty, but with the physical<lb/> element still subordinate to the moral,<lb/> without being very obviously or strain&#x00EB;dly<lb/> so. Of a Lyric especially, the scenic excellence,<lb/> however golden, should never constitute more<lb/> than a setting as it were for the gem<del>s</del><lb/> of the subject, which should always <add>be</add> something<lb/> human or having a human reference.</p></div>

<pb n="377" facs="C376/00000192.jpg"/>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. [BEGIN NOT CORRECTED]"The moral of this Poem is wrong", saith the <unclear/>
<lb/>Economist, - "egregiously wrong! All questions are <unclear/>
<lb/>questions; and the friends of young ladies act wisely, <unclear/>
<lb/>when they would induce them by all means to wed the richer <unclear/>
<lb/>of any two men: the result of a broken heart, being indeed, <lb/>just
one of those purely romantic ideas that should weigh <lb/>nothing against
the <hi rend="ul">real presence</hi> of a whole purse."</p>

<p>And having thus delivered himself, he may well <lb/>look profound, for he is
profoundly mistaken. There <lb/>is more in the matter - aye, a whole world
of things <lb/>more, than is ever dreamt of in <hi rend="ul">his</hi>
philosphy. The <lb/>mere gain of a bargain is not always its wisdom:
<lb/>nor does hardness of heart imply solidity of head.</p>

<p>"But reason, Sir, reason" - is an excellent <lb/>thing. <del>, nay,
more</del>
<add>Nay, it is more; it is</add> , an essential one. And yet no <lb/>men
have differed so widely from one another, and <lb/>from all others, in their
moral systems, as <del><unclear/></del> mere <lb/>reasoners have. "When men
begin to reason /merely/" <lb/>says Rousseau, "they cease to <hi rend="ul"
>feel</hi> " - and herein <lb/>play to their whole nature, which is
threefold; two <lb/>parts being compounded of sentiment and passion.
<lb/>But is not reason the proper guide and governor <lb/>of these? It is:
but it should guide and govern <lb/>them through a knowledge and <hi
rend="ul">feeling</hi> of their <lb/>principles, and not according to
theories drawn exclusive- <lb/>-ly from its own; for if too dogmatically
relied on, it <lb/>becomes the mere egg-bag of heartless conventions.
<lb/>And at this point, I believe, we stand over the <pb n="378"
facs="C376/00000193.jpg"/>
<unclear/> anomaly of human life - that perpetual <lb/><unclear/> fare
between the wisdom of the heart and the wisdom <lb/><unclear/> the head.</p>

<p>But to dip deeper into the matter. The dry <lb/>logical definer of human
proprieties, has rarely <lb/>any moral and mental progressiveness. Neither
does <lb/>the mere laying together of the dry bones of a social
<lb/>argument require much grasp of intellect or <lb/>harmony of feeling.
Hence a merely reasoning <lb/>Utilitarian seldom makes a lasting impression
<lb/>upon the great heart of mankind. He may <lb/>present us with an outward
frame, - a skeleton <lb/>of truth, anatomically put together, but it asks
<lb/>genius in addition to "create a soul under <lb/><hi rend="ul">its</hi>
ribs of death." Besides, if a mere reasoner <lb/>commences in error, he is
even afterwards hopelessly <lb/>astray. Dealing only with the successional
links <lb/>of his subject, the further he goes the further he <lb/>errs. A
man of a largely feeling as well as <lb/>thinking intelligence, on the
contrary, seldom affects <lb/>the beaten and outside logic of things. He
dashes <lb/>rather into their principles. He yearns more after
<lb/>communion with the order of their inner spirit, <lb/>than with their
material congruities. Hence <lb/>such a being is never entirely lost to
truth. He <lb/>will often leap into the full blaze of its light <lb/>over
the very fences of error. The real and <pb n="379" facs="C376/00000193.jpg"
/> living consonance of human passions and interests, <unclear/>
<lb/>than their apparent and subjective agreement, being <unclear/>
<lb/>object, becomes progressively more and more his possession
<unclear/></p>

<p>To arrive then at a just and comprehensive idea <unclear/>
<lb/>the harmonious in society, we must give intellectual sea- <lb/>-room to
the whole man within us. In such a course <lb/>resides the truthful
influence of genius; and out of <lb/>such a course is evoked the prophecy of
the "good <lb/>time coming."</p>

<p>Still I must not be mistaken. I am no <lb/>advocate for imprudent
love-matches <hi rend="ul">as such.</hi>
<lb/>All I would urge on that head, is, that when once <lb/>the affections
are engaged or pledged, - then thier <lb/>plea should be held paramount to
all selfish <lb/>considerations; then a single worldly reservation <lb/>is
an inlet to dishonor and indevotion - from which <lb/>good can never
come.</p>

<p>Marry for Love, and labor diligently together <lb/>afterwards for the goods
things of the world, is <lb/>both a wise and a hearty motto for the young of
both <lb/>sexes. For love in the married state will ever be found <lb/>the
best promoter even of those very prudential and industrious
<lb/>dispositions which most conduce to its ultimate worldly
<lb/>prosperity: while without it, there <del>will</del>
<add>is</add> always a <lb/>conjugal dissatisfaction of passion, disposing
its <lb/>victim more or less, according to temperament, to <lb/>practical
excesses in some direction. At all events, <lb/>the want of it, <del>I
say</del>, - as in the case of the <lb/>long unmarried, must naturally
originate some <pb n="380" facs="C376/00000194.jpg"/>
<unclear/> craving for social compensation, the more <lb/><unclear/>
unfavorable to constancy of conduct <lb/><unclear/> its <hi rend="ul">very
vaguness.</hi></p>

<p>The heart then is the most central thing of <lb/>human life as well as of the
human body; and <lb/>it will never therefore rest contentedly in the
<lb/>meagreness of purely conventional results. Add to <lb/>this, that the
merest propensity has its sacred rights; <lb/>and that to make it a rebel,
either openly or in secret, <lb/>little more is needed in a majority of
cases, than <lb/>to gall it by some inappropriate restriction or
<lb/>denial. And then let us ask ourselves, <del>why</del> why <lb/>in the
solicitude of our wordly wisdom, we do <lb/>not fathom more attentively
these undercurrents of <lb/>humanity, in order to patch thence a necessary,

<l>Plainly then, as in a book,</l>
<l>Might he read in every look</l>
<l>How her secret heart was smarting:</l>
<l>And in the agony betraying</l>

<l>Go not yet, not <del>just</del> yet.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then he left her, all relying</l>
<l>On the love he'd so mista'en&#x2014;</l>
<l>Only to return in vain</l>
<l>When that gentle Girl was dying!</l>
<l>And then how bitterly repentance</l>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><ref>*</ref> The simplicities of song which dallied with the<lb/> innocence of love and beauty, and centred their melo-<lb/>dious spells amid the quiet sanctities of Home, are<lb/> fast giving place in our popular literature to what?<lb/>&#x2014;to versified ball-room rivalries and metrical whis-<lb/>kerandoes. Still the "fit audience though few"<lb/> ask for the old familiar faces of Poesy, or others<lb/> equally truthful&#x2014;and occasionally, equally <emph rend="it">homely</emph>.<lb/> Of this I am certain, that there is not anything more<lb/> strikingly indicative of the characters of individuals<lb/> than the quality of their favourite songs&#x2014;of the<lb/> character of ladies especially. Those, for instance,<lb/> who affect the moonshine of "meet me in the willow<lb/> glen" popularities, have usually just as much outside<lb/> display and as little sterling pith as the <emph rend="it">no</emph>-things<lb/> they <emph rend="it">execute</emph>. Then the would-be "Rover's Brides"<lb/> are always rather too remarkable for a sort of melo-<lb/>dramatic contempt of the <emph rend="it">mine-versus-thine</emph> pro-<lb/>prieties of ordinary mortals.

Those, on the other hand, who would be<lb/> "butterflies born in bowers," and "fairies living in<lb/> flowers," are mostly such sexual inanities, morally<lb/> and physically, as the epistolary Amelia <emph rend="it">Scraggs:</emph><lb/> the very best specimens of this species of petticoat<lb/> being only <emph rend="it">at home</emph> in fabricating indifferent wax-<lb/>work roses, bad poems, and worse puddings.</p>

<p>But show me <del>those</del> amongst our women, <add>those</add> who love with<lb/> a quiet yet earnest constancy the simple touching<lb/> pathos of our old home ditties, and I will show <emph rend="it">you</emph>,<lb/> reader, the gems richer than all their <emph rend="it">sex</emph>&#x2014;albeit<lb/> too often thrown away, Desdemona-like, by the<lb/> "base <subst><del>Indians"</del> <add>Judeans"</add></subst> of mankind.

But what if Jonathan<lb/> should send them a whole cargo, and plead in justi-<pb n="439" facs="C376/00000223.jpg"/>fication, as he very likely would, that he furnished<lb/> the said "villainous saltpetre" under the sanction of<lb/> that <emph rend="it">national flag</emph> which the consistent British Go-<lb/>vernment accorded to the New Zealanders a few<lb/> years since? and in virtue also of the admitted in-<lb/>dependence of their several chieftainships?

<p rend="indent">As to John Heki, if there be any such thing as<lb/> patriotism&#x2014;<emph rend="it">he</emph> is a patriot.

Noble, I<lb/> say, was that outbreak, whatever may be its ultimate<lb/> issue; and consoling was it to every true patriot,<lb/> however he might deplore its concomitant bloodshed;<lb/> for it was an assurance to him that the spirits of<lb/> Sparta's "three hundred," with those of Wallace,<lb/> and Tell, and Hofer, and Emmet, had not <emph rend="it">all</emph> aban-<lb/>doned the unworthy earth.</p>

<l>As it ascends, a hundred lesser stems</l>
<l>Branch off, and so, contorting all, are led</l>
<l>Upward and spreadingly against the stones:</l>
<l>And thus it well beseems a fairy picture</l>
<l>Of some vast vegetable wonder, such</l>
<l>As only is seen, in mighty growth, to climb</l>
<l>The face precipitous of some Indian Alp.<ref target="0">*</ref></l>
<l>Then, midway up the wall, its wide-spread boughs</l>
<l>No further stayed, lop outward in a mass,</l>
<l>And by their weight of leaves, as still the sprays</l>
<l>Keep tapering <del>all</del>, are <add>all</add> curved into a dome:</l>
<l>A leafy Heaven! from whose vernal skies</l>
<l>A thousand glowingly consummate blooms,</l>
<l>Pensile and round, gaze smiling down upon me!</l>
<l>Even like the faces of so many Cherubs,</l>
<l>Wing-frilled, and flushing with celestial health.</l></lg></div>

<l>No matter:&#x2014;they ll outlast his epitaph!<ref target="0">*</ref></l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><ref>*</ref> It has always been a puzzle to really large-minded, full-hearted<lb/> men, by what <hi rend="it">outre</hi> and antipodean combination of circumstances<lb/> this man could ever have been lifted into prime political eminence.<lb/> As an orator, he is a mere blearer. As a statesman, he is crudity<lb/> personified. As a lawyer, he is but so so; consistency he has none:<lb/> and for <emph rend="it">patriotism</emph>&#x2014;but listen to Doll Tearsheets' dissertation on<lb/> the words <hi rend="it">Captain</hi> and <hi rend="it">occupy</hi>. "Captain! thou abominable<pb n="448" facs="C376/00000229.jpg"/> damned cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called&#x2014;Captain? * *<lb/> You a captain, you slave! for what? * * A Captain! these<lb/> villains will make the word Captain as odious as the word <hi rend="it">occupy</hi>,<lb/> which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted: therefore<lb/> <hi rend="it">Captains</hi> had need look to it." Now the word patriot is undergoing<lb/> a process precisely analogous to this, at the dirty hands of our<lb/> Pistolian "Billy Winfends," who will eventually make it as disre-<lb/>putable as the term "white washing," which was a good one enough<lb/> before it was roguishly applied: therefore <hi rend="it">patriots</hi> had need look to it.</p>

<postscript><p rend="indent">P.S.&#x2014;The above lines were written two or three years since&#x2014;all<lb/> but the four in italics, which were recently introduced; and the<lb/> occasion of which has set the author upon tracing out, in plain but<lb/> pounding prose, the brassy career of our so called great Australian<lb/> Patriot! Of his private character, of course, as the writer cares<lb/> nothing, he shall say nothing. It is that huge blind boil, the legis-<lb/>lative part of him, that alone which the writer has to lay open to the<lb/> pestilent core. (And a nasty job it is!) It is his political consis-<lb/>tency&#x2014;or rather inconsistency that the writer has to compel into<lb/> the broad daylight, as a big blustering, but surely detected felon is<lb/> dragged, say into the Sydney Police Court&#x2014;with, however, Jemmy<lb/> Martin to plead for him. Long eared Jemmy, who butters Wentworth<lb/> to his face, descriptively, as "that great man!" But lord, its quite<lb/> natural. The veriest pimple of a human head&#x2014;even Jemmy's own<lb/> &#x2014;is a mountain to a louse: and the two together are perfectly and<lb/> analogically suggestive of the reason whereby it comes that "Billy<lb/> Wentworth" is really a <emph rend="it">great</emph> man to Jemmy Martin.</p></postscript>

<signed>C.H.</signed></div>

<div type="Hnote">

<p><add>The above Postscript was appended to the<lb/> foregoing Series and Note on their being <emph rend="ul">pub-<lb/>-lished</emph> in the People's Advocate. The design intima-<lb/>-ted in it, I dropped, thinking the subject not worth<lb/> the powder. Still, as to Wentworth, a word or two<lb/> more in this place, "once for all". It is still<lb/> contended that he is a <emph rend="ul">great man</emph>&#x2014;the "great<lb/> son of the soil", and so forth: and if indeed, he is to<lb/> be thus regarded as the authentic and pristine<lb/> type of Australian <emph rend="ul">greatness</emph>,&#x2014;God help<lb/> Australia! for she must be otherwise predestined<lb/> to extreme moral and mental destitution. Now<lb/> I grant to Wentworth, a certain measure of rude<lb/> intellectual power, and even a vast amount of<lb/> selfish energy; but something of beauty and grace and<lb/> truthfulness, in addition, are necessary, to my<lb/> thinking, to establish a claim to the possession<lb/> of even second rate human greatness. The qualities<lb/> of justice, honesty, and fraternal faith and hope,<lb/> in holy alliance with Genius, or the highest order<lb/> of talent,&#x2014;these constitute true greatness in<lb/> man. But will Wentworth's measure up to<lb/> such a standard? Not by a thousand spiritual<lb/> leagues. Productiveness of enduring good results<lb/> is also an essential element and test of real<lb/> greatness,&#x2014;that is, of greatness worthy of<lb/> being publicly so called. But will Wentworth's bear any<lb/> such test? What "thing of beauty" has he<lb/> created? What great principle has he built<lb/> up and fortified for the future? In one word,<lb/> were he dead tomorrow, what noble, or<lb/> truthful, or beneficient thing, of all that he<lb/> has done under the sun, would survive him<lb/> as a legacy to his country and his kind? Nothing of the<lb/> kind,&#x2014;positively nothing! Then would it be<lb/> seen, unmistakably, that in all these regards,<lb/> he was but like the barren fig tree of Scripture,<lb/>&#x2014;a cumberer of the ground. If, however,<lb/> it be yet argued in behalf of his <emph rend="ul">greatness</emph>, that, in the<lb/> Colonial past, he was a stickler for Trial by<lb/> Jury,&#x2014;what of that? Had he conceived or<lb/> created the thing, that indeed would have been<lb/> <emph rend="ul">something</emph> smacking of absolute greatness. As it was, he was but contending,<lb/> from motives of mere opposition, for an obvious<lb/> right,&#x2014;obvious to the veriest dullard; and which<lb/> would have been granted as a matter of course<lb/> so soon as the Colony forewhent that very penal<lb/> condition into which he,&#x2014;the same Wentworth,&#x2014;<lb/>would now again degrade it. And for what?<lb/> That he himself, and his class, might have labor<lb/> for next to nothing. Away then, forever,<lb/> with this balderdash about Wentworth's<lb/> greatness! C.H.</add></p>

<head type="title">My Sable Fair.</head>

<lg><l n="1">The Maidens of Bushton are rare and bright,</l>
<l>Have forms for sculpture, and souls for delight,</l>
<l>With wiles to witch one, and smiles to please,</l>
<l>And tears that are even more sweet than these:</l>
<l>But turning from all, though thus bright and <del>bright</del>, rare,</l>
<l>I follow my heart to my Sable Fair.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Dark is her cheek, but the rich blood's ray</l>
<l>Glows through its night with the warmth of day;</l>
<l>While Joy, like a <subst><del>[?]breathing [?]nature</del> <add>[unclear]</add></subst>, sips</l>
<l>The love-ripe dew of her smiling lips,</l>
<l>And her wild eyes shine, like twin-stars rare,</l>
<l>Out from a cloud of glossy hair.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And ever I pride in my Forest choice</l>
<l>The more <subst><del>when</del> <add>while</add></subst> I list to her bird-like voice,</l>
<l>Warbling <subst><del>[unclear]</del> <add>old songs</add></subst> in her own wild speech</l>
<l><del>Old songs</del>, with this burden new to each:</l>
<l>"Who will pity the dark-wing'd Dove,</l>
<l>When her white Hawk leaves her to die of love?"</l></lg>

<lg><l>O then, by the artless tears that rise</l>
<l>'Neath the downcast lids of her gleaming eyes;</l>
<l>By the truthfully tender and touching grace</l>
<l>That boding passion there lends her face;</l>
<l>In the depths of my yearning soul, I swear</l>
<l>Never to leave her&#x2014;my Sable Fair!</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note</hi>. This poem was suggested by the following passage<lb/> (extracted by permission) in a private letter.

<q><p>"It is indeed true, that young x x x has openly<pb n="461/3" facs="C376/00000235.jpg"/> attached himself to an aboriginal girl here, though,<lb/> as you observe, he stood A.1. in the graces of some of the finest<lb/> belles in &#x2014;&#x2014;; a fact certainly, which in nowise tends to his<lb/> excuse. Yet, I can assure you, the <hi rend="ul">sable fair one</hi> who has<lb/> thus bewitched him, is quite a Bush Cleopatra, possessing<lb/> much striking though wild beauty. To see her in motion,<lb/> is immediately to bethink one of a black antelope, or of some<lb/> graceful wild creature of the sort; while her head of hair on<lb/> the poll of an Opera dancer (to say the very least of it) were<lb/> predestined to a coronet."</p>

<p rend="indent">The Poem itself has been censured as being too impas-<lb/>sioned for the subject and too glossy: and as showing the Poet to have entered<lb/> too <hi rend="ul">con amore</hi> also into the color of its circumstances. But<lb/> such conventional cant is easily "sent to Coventry". The Poet's<lb/> theme was granted love, and what has its wild spirit, when<lb/> once evoked, to do with the accident of a black or a white skin?<lb/> That subtile power of passion which cometh as unbiddenly<lb/> as the "breath of the sweet South over a bed of violets, stealing and<lb/> giving odours", and finding "Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt"&#x2014;<lb/>what careth it, I would ask, in the presence of its object, for<lb/> arbitrary proprieties? And was the Poet, with these questions<lb/> at his heart, to caution the Muse, notwithstanding, against<lb/> skipping over the clipt-hedge-like limits of modern literary<lb/> gentility? I mean that small straight laced sentimental<lb/> sort of verse-test which obtains so mightily amongst learned<lb/> old maids and Montgomery-reading bachelors. But the<lb/> words quoted above from Shakespear, are alone suggestive of an<lb/> answer sufficiently conclusive&#x2014;and I consider the objections,<lb/> therefore, as "sent to Coventry".</p></q></p></div>

<head type="title">Morning.</head>

<lg><l n="1">How beautiful that <del>[unclear]</del> earliest burst of light</l>
<l>Which floodeth from the opening eye of Morn,</l>
<l>When like a fairy palace, dew bedight,</l>
<l>Bough storying over bough, upsp[r]eads the thorn!</l>
<l>And sweet the melodies which tow'rd the corn</l>
<l>In tassel, or the orchard, then invite;</l>
<l>And that most love-like, ever fresh delight</l>
<l>Which breathes of many a bloomy thing new born;&#x2014;</l>
<l>Breathes from vine clumps in the moist dells appearing,</l>
<l>Rich meads and river banks. And cheering then</l>
<l>The voice of cattle to their pasture steering,</l>
<l>And the full speech of fieldward hastening men.&#x2014;</l>

Every word is moist with the dewy<lb/> freshness of the orient, and glows with a positional splen-<lb/>-dor that may well seem to have been flushed into it by the<lb/> veritable presence of Aurora herself. The passage in<lb/> Paradise Lost, beginning "Now Morn her rosy steps in<lb/> the eastern clime" &amp;c&#x2014;that passage alone will fully<lb/> acquit <subst><del>the</del> <add>these</add></subst> remarks of <subst><del>the slightest</del> <add>any</add></subst> approach to extravagance<lb/>&#x2014;Shakespear also, has interwoven with the mortal<lb/> business of his <del>[?]scenes</del> subjects, such rosy streaks and<lb/> golden dashes of his morning memories, as are only<lb/> to be equalled in beauty and richness by their recurrent<lb/> realities. And they are even more prizeable than they,<lb/> because <del>fixed and encompassed</del> everlastingly fixed and<lb/> encompassed, as a universal intellectual possession, by the<lb/> spiritual bounds of an immortalised sympathy: <add><add>because</add> In other words, they are rich and racy<lb/> draughts of the morning tide, as quaffed and relished<lb/> by Shakspear, and to partake of which, is to become<lb/> in spirit, for the time, a quest of the Immortals.</add>&#x2014;The<lb/> lusty spirit of old Chaucer, too, ever and anow, is fairly<lb/> heard <emph rend="ul">to crow</emph> for exceeding joy in the bright and breezy<lb/> mornings of the Past.</p></div>

    so precariously provided for as Man's. Hence, <lb/>however it may have
    broken promise with is in the past, <lb/>we should still cherish it with

<head type="title">To My Neece, Mary,<lb/> The Daughter of J. J Harpur.</head>

<lg><l n="1">Dear Mary, I have often thought</l>
<l>To frame a verse of two for thee;</l>
<l>That henceforth thou mightst feel, as taught</l>
<l>By something learned of me.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Thou know&#x00E8;st (seeing 'tis thy lot</l>
<l>To commune with a Sire refined)</l>
<l>That Loveliness which fadeth not,</l>
<l>Is only of the mind.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But there's another phase of Truth,</l>
<l>Which yet, perhaps, thou dost not know;</l>
<l>And which, if given to thy youth,</l>
<l>May teach thee how to grow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>There are even in the body springs</l>
<l>That mix with what we still approve;</l>
<l>And thereby mould it tow'rds the things</l>
<l>We most admire and love.</l></lg>

<lg><l>With Goodness, then, keep friendship still,</l>
<l>With Truth, and Chastity, and Grace;</l>
<l>And lo! the sweetness of thy will</l>
<l>Shall settle in thy face.</l></lg>

<lg><l>With Poesie communion make,</l>
<l>And with all Arts of gentle kind;</l>
<l>And lo! thy maiden form shall take</l>
<l>The temper of thy mind.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> I would confirm the impression of the above<lb/> verses by noting here in plain prose, that I do verily be-<lb/>lieve our mental tasts (in early life at least) are greatly<lb/> influential in shaping <del>our bodies</del> and characterising<lb/> our bodies: not merely or solely by outward appliances<lb/> open to all, in conjunction with habit,&#x2014;such as staying <pb n="465/9" facs="C376/00000238.jpg"/> the bust, to taper and keep it erect, drilled attitudes,<lb/> studied featural expressions, and so forth; but also by<lb/> superinducing certain physical idiosyncracies which<lb/> operate from within, and are limited to individuals,<lb/> or classes of individuals. And I gather this belief<lb/> from much observation, as well as from the idealisms<lb/> of the <del>[unclear]</del> Muse.</p></div>

<head type="title">Beauty.</head>

<lg><l n="1">First in the human form and face so fair</l>
<l>'Tis seen, and in all shapes of animal being;</l>
<l>Also in things inanimate if rare;</l>
<l>In blending colors next, and sounds agreeing,</l>
<l>Till Thought grows gifted with that inward seeing</l>
<l>Which finds it in the mind beyond compare,</l>
<l>And in the infinite combinations there</l>
<l>Of memory or knowledge, fixed or fleeing.</l>
<l>The inmost spirit of all truth, it hues</l>
<l>The countenance of Science; throbs like thought</l>
<l>In every star of heaven, and embues</l>
<l>All the moon looks on; to the heart is brought</l>
<l>Alive in every sunbeam, if, love taught,</l>
<l>Such bright communion it would not refuse.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note</hi>. But the subtlest considerations of Beauty lie<lb/> beyond all this. Whether does it exist in the mind<lb/> alone, or in its outward objects alone, when in combin-<lb/>-ative connexion with it&#x2014;or partly in the essence of<lb/> both? I think that it <emph rend="ul">resides</emph> at least partly in<lb/> both. Without mind to perceive and combine, there<lb/> would be no outward beauty: but mind would be also<lb/> barren of it, without the external objects thus perceived<lb/> and combined. It is therefore a certain joint result<lb/> of the relation subsisting between Mind and Matter,<lb/> when harmonious and happy. In the material<lb/> world it is the impassioned glow of Truth or Fit-<lb/>-ness in fruition with a perceiving Intelligence. In<lb/> the ideal or spiritual world,&#x2014;that is, in the mind<lb/> itself, it is the Desirable, or the possible in Perfection,<lb/> as "bodied forth" and naturalised by a combining<lb/> Imagination.</p></div>

<head type="title">The Emigrant's Vision.</head>

<lg><l n="1">As our bark dashed away o'er the night shrouded deep,</l>
<l>And out tow'rds the South I was gazing,</l>
<l>O'er my soul first there gathered a dimness like sleep,</l>
<l>Then the light of a Vision amazing.</l>
<l>As rises the moon, from the white waves afar</l>
<l>Came a Goddess, it seemed, of love wisdom and war,</l>
<l>And on her bright helmet, encircling a star,</l>
<l rend="indent">Behold there was graven&#x2014;Australia.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Her robes were as green as the mantle of Spring,</l>
<l>Newly spread by the streams that so mildly</l>
<l>Elapse through yon flock-legioned plains, or that sing</l>

<pb n="467/11" facs="C376/00000239.jpg"/>

<l>'Mid those blue-ranging mountains so wildly;</l>
<l>Her locks were as bright as the lustre that lies</l>
<l>At morn on the seas of the South, and her eyes</l>
<l>Were as deep in their joy as the clear sunny skies&#x2014;</l>
<l rend="indent">The clear sunny skies of Australia.</l></lg>

<lg><l>O Stranger, she asked, hast thou fled from the home</l>
<l>Which thy fathers have bled for so vainly?</l>
<l>Or does shame for its past thus disgust thee to roam?</l>
<l>Or dispair of his future constrain thee?</l>
<l>In the far sunny South there's a refuge from wrong,</l>
<l>Where the Shiloh of Freedom, expected so long,</l>
<l>To Genius already has shouted his song&#x2014;</l>
<l rend="indent">'Tis the evergreen Land of Australia!</l></lg>

<lg><l>There Truth her abode on the forest-clad hills</l>
<l>Shall establish, a dweller for ever;</l>
<l>And Plenty rejoice by the thence-flowing rills</l>
<l>Aye wedded to honest endeavour:</l>
<l>Till a numberless People the future shall see,</l>
<l>All equally noble as equally free,&#x2014;</l>
<l>And the God they adore their sole monarch shall be!</l>
<l rend="indent">Then come; build thy Home in Australia.</l></lg>

<lg><l>This said tow'rds the South she passed brightly away,</l>
<l>And at once as from slumber I started:</l>
<l>But the cadences sweet of its welcoming lay</l>
<l>Yet breathed of the Vision departed.</l>
<l>And when o'er the deep these had fadingly spread,</l>
<l>The swell of my heart, as it throbbed to my head,</l>
<l>Seemed to break into words on my tongue&#x2014;and I said</l>
<l rend="indent">Be the home of my hope then, Australia.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> I speak in the Text of plenty in this country<lb/> being ever wedded or weddable to honest endeavour.<lb/> This is true enough. Any industrious man, if he<lb/> be sober and healthy as well, can better his material<lb/> circumstances in Australia: that is, supposing them<lb/> bad at starting, and comparatively so at other periods,<pb n="468/12" facs="C376/00000240.jpg"/> given progressively. And yet, in the present state<lb/> of its society, as of all society perhaps, so mortal hard<lb/> is it to get together the first,&#x2014;the nest egg of our<lb/> fortunes, that the heart, however good at first, is ruined<lb/> in the process. In making this nest egg,&#x2014;that is, the<lb/> first hundred, or thousand pounds, we have so to toil,<lb/> and pinch, and screw, and lie, and haggle, that all<lb/> which was primatively genial in our social being,&#x2014;<lb/> the "milk of human kindness",&#x2014;is utterly strained<lb/> out of us. Our hearts have passed, as it were,<lb/> through a cheese-press; not to be thereby bettered,<lb/> as cheese is, but to be thoroughly hardened, like<lb/> stones. Hence the worldly inexorableness of all<lb/> our elderly men; their cold, cruel,<lb/> Satanic want of faith in everything but money.<lb/> But it will be their mortal doom to find, each and<lb/> all of them, in the end&#x2014;that money is not <emph rend="ul">every<lb/> thing</emph>. It can buy much indeed;&#x2014;but it cannot<lb/> buy enduring honor; nor truth (for an unrighteous<lb/> end;) nor a good conscience; nor love in its first<lb/> integrity, glowing and unselfish as a wing&#x00E8;d thing<lb/> from heaven; nor more than the semblance of<lb/> friendship,&#x2014;not the substance; nor intellectual power;<lb/> nor even a fine capacity for the enjoyment of mere<lb/> bodily pleasure. And thus then we see, that every<lb/> thing of supremes value,&#x2014;[?]everything [?]worthiest of our desire,&#x2014;<lb/> is unpurchaseable by money.</p></div>

<l>Day by day was at my side</l>
<l>Amid the hills where I was born,</l>
<l>And if it went at eventide,</l>
<l>It came again with morn;</l>
<l>And 'twas the last that blest me, when</l>

They<lb/> haunt my sense of the past in a manner I cannot<lb/> explain to any <add>intelligible</add> purpose, perhaps.

    <add>ideas</add> <lb/>(when they make any moral and social progress at all), as <lb/>they do
    from feudal and despotic ones to those of a <lb/>limited monarchy. This is

    Let civilised <lb/>men be but placed for a few generations beyond the direct

    <lb/>before they can render a definite reason, it may be, <lb/>for the
    "faith that is in them." And this results, I <lb/>repeat it, from a moral
    and social progress purely <lb/>natural to civilised men <add>though
        <unclear/> of peculiar circumstances</add>. The empires, kingdoms,
    <lb/>and aristocracies of Europe were founded either in <lb/>military
    dictation, or piece-meal conquest by pro- <lb/>-vincial combinations, during
    barbarous or semi- <lb/>barbarous times, and have been perpetuated by
    <lb/>force and craft, either despotic or legal; - by state <lb/>debts and
    unequal taxes (as in England), which <lb/>stipend and favor the wealthy,
    while they grind <lb/>the poor into abjectness; or by imperial war-craft
    &amp; <lb/>the not less imperial knout (as in Russia), which
    <lb/>brutalise men into hordes of bloodhounds: and they <lb/>neither would
    have originated in enlightened times, <lb/>nor could have obtained over
    communities <unclear>provisnal</unclear>
    <lb/>civilised, in any rational and rightly-applied sense <lb/>of the
    term.</p>

<p>But though utterly a republican in my politics, <lb/>speculatively, I yet
    believe, that will be best for <lb/>Australia to continue during the present
    century <lb/>(at the very least) a part of the British monarchy. <lb/>For
    even the state-<unclear>botches</unclear> of Downing Street are <pb n="473"
        facs="C376/00000242.jpg"/> full fifty years in advance of our

    <lb/>wool-kings; and such forms of Government therefore, as <lb/>they may
    from time to time fabricate for us, though upon <lb/>the most thread bare
    models, will be altogether preferable <lb/>to any things of the kind which
    the latter would or could <lb/>tinker up <del><unclear/></del> in the event
    of a premature separation. <lb/>And hence I have called the poem,
    parenthetically in <ref target="C376-00000242">*</ref>
    <lb/>the heading, - a Song for the Future.</p>

<p>But the mere form of a Government is, after all, <lb/>a question of only
    secondary importance. With our <lb/>prime moral and intellectual rights
    thoroughly - that is, <lb/>constitutionally secured to us; namely, the right
    of all <lb/>free men to pursue together, upon political and social
    <lb/>terms of perfect equality, both their own individual <lb/>happiness and
    their country's welfare; to discuss <lb/>publicly any and every public
    matter; and to dissent <lb/>openly from any system of Religion, or
        <del><unclear/></del> conform <del><unclear/></del>
    <lb/>unmolestedly to any mode of worship, however pe- <lb/>-culiar; with
    these great rights thus secured, the <del><unclear/></del>
    <lb/>more official machinery of a Government were, in <lb/>fact, but a
    progression testing and development of the <lb/>best modes of
    inter-municipal combination, for the <lb/>general good and security of the
    State. And thus simpli- <lb/>fied, its places, - being conferative of
    onorous honor <lb/>rather than of pecuniary emolument or political
        <lb/><del><unclear/></del> patronage, would no longer be gambled
        <add>and <unclear>scramelled</unclear></add> for, <lb/>as hitherto, by
    countryless lawyers and unprincipled <lb/>men of talent; nor would they be
    convertible, as heretofore, <lb/>into baits and bribes for furthering the
    worst designs <lb/>of the self-begodding ambitionist. [END NOT CORRECTED]</p>

<head type="title">The Creek of the Four Graves.</head>

<lg><l n="1">I verse a Settler's Tale of the Old Times&#x2014;</l>
<l>One told me by our friend, the kindly sage,</l>
<l>Old Egremont; who then went forth with four</l>
<l>Of his most trusty and adventurous men</l>
<l>Into the wilderness;&#x2014;went forth to seek</l>
<l>New streams and wider pastures, for his fast</l>
<l>Encreasing flocks and herds;&#x2014;went forth on foot;</l>
<l>For horses then were cattle of too great price</l>
<l>To be much ventured upon mountainous routes,</l>
<l>And into brush lands perilously pathless.</l></lg>

<pb n="474/18" facs="C376/00000243.jpg"/>

<lg><l rend="indent">So went they forth at dawn: and now the sun,</l>
<l>That rose behind them as they journeyed out,</l>
<l>Was firing with his nether rim a range</l>
<l>Of unknown mountains, that, like rampires, towered</l>
<l>Full in their front; and his last glances fell</l>
<l>Into the glooming forest's eastern glades</l>
<l>In golden masses, transciently, or flashed</l>
<l>Down on the windings of a nameless creek,</l>
<l>That fringed with oaks and the wild willow, ran</l>
<l>Noiselessly on, between the pioneers</l>
<l>And those new eminences.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">Wilder grew</l>
<l>The Scene each moment,&#x2014;beautifully wilder!</l>
<l>For when the sun was all but sunk beyond</l>
<l>Those barrier mountains,&#x2014;then within a breeze</l>
<l>That o'er their rigid and enormous backs</l>
<l>Deep fleeced with wood, came whispering down, the wide</l>
<l>Slant sea of leaves stirr'd in the slanting rays,</l>
<l>Stirr'd interdazzlingly, as though the trees</l>
<l>That bare them, were all thrilling,&#x2014;tingling all</l>
<l>Even to the roots for very happ[i]ness;</l>
<l>So prompted from within, so sentient, seemed</l>
<l>The bright quick motion.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">Halting wearied, here</l>
<l>Our Travellers kindled for their first night's camp</l>
<l>The brisk and crackling fire, which also looked</l>
<l>A wilder creature than 'twas elsewhere wont,</l>
<l>Because of the surrounding savageness:</l>
<l>And soon in pots of tin the tea was made</l>
<l>Fragrant and strong, the fresh-sliced rasher broiled</l>
<l>On the live embers, and as soon dispatched</l>
<l>By the keen <subst><del>edge</del> <add>tooth</add></subst> of healthful appetite.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">And as they supt, birds of new shape and plume</l>
<l>And wild strange voice, nestward repairing by,</l>
<l>Oft took their wonder; or between the boles</l>
<l>Of the upslanting forest trees, they saw,</l>
<l>Perched on the bare abutments of those mountains,</l>
<l>The wallaroo look forth: till eastward all</l>
<l>The view had faded into formless gloom,</l>
<l>Night's front, and westward, the high massing woods,</l>
<l>Steeped in a dusk and deepening beauty, lay</l>

<pb n="475/19" facs="C376/00000243.jpg"/>

<l>Heaped all the more distinctly for their darkness</l>
<l>Against the twilight heaven, a cloudless depth</l>
<l>Yet <subst><del>lurid</del> <add>luminous</add></subst> from the sunset's fading sp[l]endor;</l>
<l>And thus, for a brief interval, they looked</l>
<l>Even like a mighty picture of themselves</l>
<l>Hung in some vaster world.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">Their supper done,</l>
<l>The echoes of the solitary place</l>
<l>Came, as in wonder, round about, to meet</l>
<l>Strange voices, moulding a strange speech, as then</l>
<l>Lifted in glee&#x2014;but to be hushed ere long,</l>
<l>As with the night, in kindred darkness, came</l>
<l>O'er the adventurers, each and all, a sense</l>
<l>Of lurking danger.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">But about the fire</l>
<l>Soon settled all, and from their fuming pipes</l>
<l>Drawing rude satisfaction, grave discourse</l>
<l>Of their peculiar business, brought to each</l>
<l>A steadier mood that reached into the night.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">The simple subject to their minds, at length,</l>
<l>Fully discussed, their couches they prepared</l>
<l>Of the green tresses of the willows there:</l>
<l>And four, as pre-arranged, <subst><del>laid them to rest</del> <add>[?]reposed their limbs</add></subst></l>
<l>Under the dark boughs of the forest, high</l>
<l>O'erdoming, and traced out against the clear</l>
<l>Wide gaze of heaven; and trustful of the watch</l>
<l>Kept <subst><del>o'er</del> <add>near</add></subst> them by their thoughtful Master, soon</l>
<l>Slept heavily; whilst every object round</l>
<l>Showed slumbrous too;&#x2014;the circling forest trees,</l>
<l>Their foremost boles carved from a crowded mass</l>
<l>Less visible, by the watch-fire's bladed gleams&#x2014;</l>
<l>And even the shaded and enormous mountains,</l>
<l>Their bluff brows glooming through the stirless air,</l>
<l>Seemed, in their quiet, solemnly asleep:</l>
<l>Yea, thence surveyed, the Universe <subst><del>appeared</del> <add>might have seemed</add></subst></l>
<l>Coiled in vast rest;&#x2014;only that one dim cloud</l>
<l>Crept, as with scrawling legs, across the sky;</l>
<l><del>And also that the multitudinous stars,</del></l>
<l><del>In their bright companies, high over all,</del></l>
<l><add>And that the stars, in their bright companies,</add></l>
<l><add>Cluster by cluster glowingly revealed</add></l>
<l><add>As it moved slowly on,&#x2014;high over all</add></l>

<l>Up from behind an eastern hill was seen</l>
<l>Conglobing, till, full orbed and large, she brought</l>
<l>He nether border level with its cone,</l>
<l>As thereon resting, edge to edge; when <del>then</del> straight</l>
<l>Its solid bulk seemed momently to grow</l>
<l><subst><del>Half</del> <add><del>All</del> Half</add></subst> saturate with her radiance; whilst the trees</l>
<l>That fringed its outline,&#x2014;their huge statures dwarfed</l>
<l>By distance into brambles, and yet all</l>
<l>Clearly defined,&#x2014;out of her very face</l>
<l>Appear[e]d to swell in <subst><del>dark</del> <add>bold</add></subst> relief, as they</l>
<l>Were sculptured from her substance.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">Egremont</l>
<l>On all this solemn beauty of the night</l>
<l>Looked out, still wakeful; for sweet thoughts of home</l>
<l>Ingathered to his heart, as by some nice</l>
<l>And subtile interfusion that connects</l>
<l>The loved and cherished (then the most, perhaps,</l>
<l>When past or absent) with the beautiful</l>
<l>And lasting things of Nature. So thought, then,</l>
<l>The musing Egremont: when suddenly,&#x2014;hark[! obscured]</l>
<l>A bough cracked loudly in a neighbouring brake,</l>
<l>And drew at once, as with a larum, all</l>
<l>His spirits thitherward.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">He listened long</l>
<l>With head bent forward, till his held breath grew</l>
<l>A pang, and his ears rung. But Silence there</l>
<l>Had recomposed her ruffled wings, and now</l>
<l>Brooded, it seemed, even stillier than before,</l>
<l>Nested in darkness: so that to his mood</l>
<l>Of museful memory he recurred ere long,</l>
<l>Calmly and reassured.</l></lg>

<lg><l type="half">But there! again!</l>
<l>And hark!&#x2014;O God! have hell's worst fiends burst up</l>
<l>Into the doom&#x00E8;d world? Or whence, it not</l>
<l>From diabolic rage, could surge a yell</l>

<l>Shone fixed and gleamy, as still waters shine</l>
<l>Under their palmy fringe. Forth then I stretched</l>
<l>My eager arms; but emptily they fell</l>
<l>Folded together on my breast&#x2014;and lo,</l>
<l>I was alone! The white and solemn light</l>
<l>Of the cold midnight moon came slantingly</l>
<l>Through the barred lattice from a cloud's dim verge;</l>
<l>The mixing murmurs of the wind were loud</l>
<l>Amongst the sycamores beyond the brook;</l>
<l>A sudden bleating from the hill-side fold</l>

<l>Lies in the damp dust tow'rds the setting sun.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> The quality of the imagery of this Poem,<lb/> classes it, I think, very markedly with the Rhymes<lb/> called "the Poet" (page ), as does also the spirit of its<lb/> design&#x2014;an attempt to compensate the heart's <subst><del>human</del> <add>inward</add></subst><lb/>destitution or loss, by surrounding its <add>complaints</add> with the bloomy<lb/> riches and happier pulsations of the outward and<lb/>visible. Hence the jar which this its general character<lb/> receives from the concluding circumstances: which<lb/> suggest<del>s</del>, in turn, the question, Should we not dispose<lb/> of our dead rather by the pyre than by burial?</p>

<p rend="indent">I think we should. The memory of their<lb/> beloved countenances would then live with the living,<lb/> unallied to the cold and wormy loathsomeness of<lb/> the grave. They would perpetually recur to our hearts<lb/> and minds, either in the beaminess of life, or in the<lb/> holy and eloquent repose of recent death;

<q><lg><l>"Before Decay's effacing fingers</l>
<l>Hath swept the lines where beauty lingers:"</l></lg></q>

and not as now, in horrible union with the festering<lb/> secrets of the shroud, and those writhing heaps of "life<lb/> in death" which <emph rend="ul">must</emph> colonise, in process of time,<pb n="480/30" facs="C376/00000246.jpg"/> the damp dust of their burial: while, in a<lb/> sanitary respect, the pyre were indisputably prefer-<lb/>-able to any mode of internment.</p>

<p rend="indent">It may be objected, however, that it were an<lb/> heathenish practice. True, the Jews always buried<lb/> their dead; but they had many other customs, both<lb/> social and pious, which christians have been wise<lb/> enough not to adhere to: and I think it can be <add>but</add> a<lb/> matter <del>but</del> of small religious account with any en-<lb/>-lightened man of the nineteenth century, by what mode<lb/> our mere bodies, after life is extinct, shall be resolved<lb/> into their primative elements. And this restores the<lb/> question to its simple sanitary bearing.</p>

<p rend="indent">Be it by fire then, the grand elemental ethereal-<lb/>izer, the supreme material purifier of this our<lb/> earth. Nor would the pyre deprive us of the venerable<lb/> ashes of our ancestors. It would only preserve these<lb/> to us in a more wholesome condition: so much so,<lb/> that the urns enclosing them might be made the<lb/> innoxious ornaments of our private homes or<lb/> public gardens.</p>

<p rend="indent">Still men's prejudices will work strongly in<lb/> favor of internment, as in the case of <del>[unclear]</del> long standing<lb/> usages of every kind. But however obstinate these<lb/> may be, and are in fact, the contrary practice of the<lb/> pyre would utterly irradicate them, it is likely, during<lb/> the passing away of a single generation: so circumstan<lb/>-tial a creature is man. In writing thus, however,<lb/> I may have been viewing the question too exclusively<lb/> through the atmosphere of poetry; and on the edge<lb/> of this doubt I will even leave it.</p></div>

<head type="title">Simplicity versus Craft</head>

<lg><l n="1">Simplicity enjoys while Craft contrives,</l>
<l>Till <del>with</del> life with both hath lost its pristine zest,</l>
<l>And the mere memory of the past survives&#x2014;</l>
<l>Of pleasure or of care;&#x2014;say, which is best?</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note&#x2014;I would rather be simple then crafty: for <add>with</add> the<lb/> simple life is a play which they enjoy as it passes; while<lb/> with the crafty it is a game, and mostly a losing<lb/> one in the end, because of the slight proportion which<lb/> their gam[e]s bear to the pains they have taken to<lb/> compass them. Suppose the play and the game <add>nearly</add> over,<lb/> <del>and</del> let us strike the balance. Simplicity has eaten the<lb/> <add>most of</add> his cake; while Craft has his yet <add>whole or in great part</add> uneaten, but with no<lb/> appetite for a final meal. The pleasure of Simplicity,<lb/> though past, was positive. The pleasure of Craft, though<lb/> yet present, is but the negative one of mere possession;<lb/> a pleasure certainly, but not<lb/> such as he thought to have&#x2014;and herein lies his<lb/> irremediable loss. But then, says Madam Economy, the<lb/> cake <emph rend="ul">remains</emph>,&#x2014;to be eaten by somebody else; even by [?]Wiseacre<lb/> his son, or by need. his heir at law. Well, even this is<lb/> but <add>the</add> spreading <add>of</add> a certain amount of enjoyment over<lb/> a greater surface: and just so far as such a result<lb/> entered into the motive of Craft's <add>game of life</add>&#x2014;just so far <add>and so far only</add> does it<lb/> acquit him of <del>absolute</del> folly&#x2014;the dry folly of a cunning<lb/> self-deception.

<head type="title">Charity.</head>

<lg><l n="1">Man were a grinding niggard, lean and hoar</l>
<l>Even in his youth, and in his riches poor,</l>
<l>Didst thou ne'er leave thy blessing at his door.</l>
<l>If not from Thee, whence were there balm to cure</l>
<l>The scornful injuries lowly hearts endure</l>
<l>From pampered Privilege? Thou art the core</l>
<l>Of Wisdom's social aim, who, all the more</l>
<l>Fierce Error threatens, toils to hold thee sure.</l></lg>

<lg><l rend="indent">On thy maternal bosom many a time</l>
<l>I lay my head, to dream that yet thy reign</l>
<l>In its completed influence every Clime</l>
<l>Shall sweeten; and as o'er some torrid plain</l>
<l>Fresh airs breathe vigor, quicken Man to gain</l>
<l>Capacity for Love's millennian prime.</l></lg></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> This Sonnet was written to shew how lovingly essential <subst><del>is</del> <add>are</add></subst> both<lb/> [so]cial and religious charity to peace and good will amongst men&#x2014;but<lb/> [w]ritten, at the same time, under a painful sense of the world-wide dearth<lb/> [of] both. In the past and present of Time, how little of the former can we<lb/> [h]istorically and currently point to. In the <emph rend="ul">now</emph> of Man's spiritual<lb/> [unclear]idance,<add>&#x2014;in the [?]look life, the unt[unclear] immortality of mind</add> how utterly is the <del>latter</del> health of the latter shrunken up and<lb/> [p]oisened by the hot and noxious breath of Sectarian intolerance! how<lb/> [gap] its mere literal form scorched and blasted by the fiery strife of creeds,<lb/> [c]alled Christian! Insomuch is this the fact, that civil laws have to be<lb/> [d]evised, either to prevent its being expunged altogether from the page of human<lb/> [d]oings, or to compensate, supplement<subst><del>arily</del><add>ally</add></subst>, <add>for</add> its foregone <subst><del>inefficiency</del> <add>insuffiency[sic]</add></subst>.</p>

<p rend="indent">Alas! the active principles of all systematised Religions (old and new),<lb/> [s]urely natural religion excepeted[sic], do certainly and very manifestly assimilate<lb/> [to] whatever is arrogant and exclusive in the dispositions of individual<lb/> [b]elievers. They would absolutely appear, from the whole stream of Church History,<lb/> [t]o be harmless only in the naturally impotent or the constitutionally indifferent.<lb/> And they operate thus, I apprehend, because all Religions, besides the one above<lb/> [e]xcepted, by futching their sanctions directly from Heaven, do thereby<lb/> [p]reclude all philosophical benefit of doubt&#x2014;the true scourse of true<lb/> charity</p>

<p rend="indent">And it may be needful that I should here define the spirit of<lb/> [c]harity in its polemical significancy. It is a largeness and liberality<lb/> [o]f soul, disposing us to credit men of opposing opinions with honesty of<pb n="516" facs="C376/00000264.jpg"/> motive, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary. It prepares us<lb/> to feel and admit also, that it
should not be assumed, that any differences<lb/> of the kind, however wide, are sufficient to exclude them from the equal<lb/> favor of the Deity. It prepares us to admit further, that in all matters<lb/> of pure speculation, it is quite possible that we ourselves may be wron[g]<lb/> and they right who rest in opposite conclusions. And finally, whethe[r]<lb/> such a possibility may be rationally grantable or not, it informs us,<lb/> that God alone, at the tribunal of Heaven, is competent and<lb/> authorised to execute judgment upon the issue.</p>

<p rend="indent">Now a State Church, by royal adoption, (God's adoption bein[g]<lb/> another thing) cannot be charitable out of the circle of its Article[s]<lb/> be they they[sic] thirty nine or ninety nine; no more than a state<lb/> nobility, by royal patent, (God's patent being another thing) can<lb/> be humble and fraternal out of the precincts of a Court. So<lb/> much for Anglican charity.</p>

<p rend="indent">Neither can Presbyterianism, though republican in its form of<lb/> government, be charitably disposed towards any other church System<lb/> or spirit of Religion, being calvinistic in its doctrine. Fire and<lb/> water; Calvinism and Charity;&#x2014;are not these but equivalent<lb/> extremes?</p>

<p rend="indent">As to the Roman Church, it does not even pretend to the<lb/> thing, otherwhere than amongst its Jesuitical outposts. Hate and<lb/> Love; the Inquisition and Charity;&#x2014;are not these too, but<lb/> equivalent extemes?</p>

<p rend="indent">That the end justifies the means is morally the most pernicious<lb/> principle under heaven: (a directly opposite principle being the true one;<lb/> namely, that the means justify the end.) And yet all zealous religionists<lb/> of every denomination act more or less under its influence. It has<lb/> especially formed a part of the <del>social</del> character of every bigoted Catholic<lb/> whose dispositions and conduct I have had sufficient opportunities for<lb/> watching and investigating: proceeding naturally enough from <subst><del>their</del> <add>the</add></subst> blindly<lb/> implicit belief in their Church's sole possess<subst><del>ing</del><add>ion</add></subst> of the truth, in <add>which</add> that Church<lb/> itself most zealously and jealously educates <del>[?]their</del> its children, or rather, its<lb/> slaves. They are walled up by it through life from all benefit of doubt. And<lb/> hence they conclude, (logically enough from such pernicious premises,) that<lb/> in subjecting any other religionist by any means, to its motherly supremacy,<lb/> they are working such essential good in his behalf, as to preclude the<lb/> very possibility of their doing him, at the same time, any essential<lb/> harm.</p></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p rend="indent"><hi rend="ul">Note.</hi> Certainly one of the best first steps towards<lb/> a rational riddance of popery, and that proud ape<lb/> of it, Anglican prelacy, is to exclude all Church Catechisms<pb n="578" facs="C376/00000295.jpg"/> from our Systems of national education.</p>

<p rend="indent">But I object to dogmatical catechisms having<lb/> an elementary place in our educational systems upon<lb/> other and higher ground. We have but to simplify<lb/> any question, to render it the more obviously truthful,<lb/> or the more evidently fallacious: and applying this<lb/> principle to the one in hand, I object to their having<lb/> any such elementary place in popular education, for the<lb/> following simple and straightforward reason:</p>

<p rend="indent">Because the truth of any and every thing which<lb/> the mind in its infancy has to be broken into the<lb/> unconditional reception of, is the very thing, beyond all<lb/> others, that it has the greatest right to reserve for future<lb/> investigation. Or to invert the principle,&#x2014;that which<lb/> it is feared the mind would not freely subscribe to in<lb/> its maturity, and when perfectly unshackled,&#x2014;is <emph rend="ul">that,</emph><lb/> of all things, which <emph rend="ul">should not</emph> be unconditionally im=<pb n="579" facs="C376/00000295.jpg"/> imposed upon it in its infancy,&#x2014;is <emph rend="ul">that</emph> indeed which<lb/> cannot be so imposed upon it without <del>[unclear]</del> hideously<lb/> dwarfing its moral stature, and doing cowardly<lb/> dishonor to its rational liberty.</p>

<p rend="indent">Still, I admit, that it is good to believe. It<lb/> gives bent and purpose to individual character; and<lb/> did these effects terminate in the individual, it were<lb/> little matter (humanly speaking) what he believed.<lb/> But inasmuch as these effects influence our conduct with<lb/> regard to other individuals, to their benefit or detriment,<lb/> and to our own reciprocally, it becomes vitally necessary<lb/> that we should only believe in what is <emph rend="ul">true</emph>, and therefore<lb/> universally fit, feasible, and fruitful of good.</p></div>

<div type="Hnote"><p>Note. Liability to Pain is the inevitable conjunct of all<lb/> physical life. Existing of necessity, in the nature of <add>mundane</add> things, wherever<lb/> there is sentient being, having a material organism, there must<lb/> suffering occasionally obtain, as a contingent of its condition: <add>: because <subst><del>insensibility</del> <add>such an organism could only be insensible to pain,</add></subst> under a great variety of circumstances, in the<lb/> event of its being also insensible to pleasure under even a greater<lb/> variety of circumstances.</add><lb/> Hence pain or suffering is in nowise chargeable, as a direct result,<lb/> upon the divine government. But why did Providence institute physical<lb/> life, if it must be thus conditionally obnoxious to such a liability?<lb/> The answer is triumphant. It was instituted by Providence, because this<lb/> fact was in its foreknowledge, that enjoyment upon the whole would<lb/> infinitely exceed the possibility of suffering; that the one would be a<lb/> universal prevalence, perpetuated through millions,&#x2014;the other but<lb/> a partial discord (so to speak) terminating in individuals.</p></div>
